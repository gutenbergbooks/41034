<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The nucleus of this volume was an address
delivered before the Pennsylvania State Bar Association
which, finding its way into various
newspapers in the United States and England,
received a degree of favorable notice that seemed
to warrant further pursuit of a subject heretofore
apparently overlooked. Successive holiday
visits to England were utilized for this purpose.</p>

<p>As our institutions are largely derived from
England, it is natural that the discussion of public
questions and the glimpses of important trials
afforded by the daily papers&mdash;usually murder
trials or divorce cases&mdash;should more or less familiarize
Americans with the English point of view
in legal matters. American lawyers, indeed,
must keep themselves in close touch with the actual
decisions which are collected in the reports
to be found in every library and which are frequently
cited in our courts.</p>

<p>Nothing in print is available, however, from
which much can be learned concerning the barristers,
the judges, or the solicitors, themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
whose labors establish these precedents. They
seem to have escaped the anthropologist, so curious
about most vertebrates, and they must be
studied in their habitat&mdash;the Inns of Court, the
musty chambers and the courts themselves.</p>

<p>The more these almost unknown creatures are
investigated, the more will the pioneer appreciate
the difficulty of penetrating the highly specialized
professional life of England, of mastering
the many peculiar customs and the elaborate
etiquette by which it is governed and of reproducing
the atmosphere of it all. He will find
that he can do little but record his observations.</p>

<p>It was not unknown to him that some lawyers
in England are called barristers, some solicitors,
and he had a vague impression that the former,
only, are advocates, whose functions and activities
differ from those of the solicitor; but he was
hardly conscious that the two callings are as unlike
as those of a physician and an apothecary.
It requires personal observation to see that the
barristers, belonging to a limited and somewhat
aristocratic corps, less than 800 of whom monopolize
the litigation of the entire Kingdom, have
little in common with the solicitors, scattered all
over England. The former are grouped together
in their chambers in the Inns, their clients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
are solicitors only, they have no contact, perhaps
not even an acquaintance, with the actual
litigants and a cause to them is like an abstract
proposition to be scientifically presented. The
solicitors, on the other hand, constitute the men
of law-business, whose clients are the public, but
who can not themselves appear as advocates and
must retain the barristers for that purpose.</p>

<p>Again, it is difficult to grasp fully the influence
exercised through life by the barrister's
Inn&mdash;that curious institution, with its five hundred
years of tradition&mdash;voluntarily joined by
him when a youth; where he has received his
training; by which he has been called to the Bar
and may be disbarred for cause, and upon the
Benchers of which Inn he must naturally look
as his exemplars, although the Lord Chancellor
may be the nominal creator of King's Counsel
and the donor of judge-ships. The impulse of
these Inns is still felt at the American Bar, despite
more than a century's separation, for, about
the time of the Revolution, over a hundred
American law students were in attendance, not
only acquiring, for use in the new country, a
sound legal training, but absorbing the spirit of
the profession which has been transmitted to posterity,
although its source may be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Nor will anything he has read prepare the
American for the abyss which separates the common
law barrister, who spends his days in jury
trials, from the chancery man, who knows nothing
but equity courts; nor for the complete ignorance,
if not contempt, with which they seem
to regard each other.</p>

<p>K. C.'s, indeed, are afforded their title in the
reports&mdash;even in the newspapers&mdash;but nowhere
does it appear that "Leaders" are appointed by
the judge of a particular equity court to "take
their seats" and practice before him exclusively,
being associated in each case with "Juniors,"
who in turn have "Devils" to prepare their cases;
or that a leader may sever this relation and
thereafter "go special"; yet all these, and many
other peculiar and inviolable customs, are handed
down from one generation to another to be followed
as if by instinct: and the profession would
no more trouble the busy world with such matters
than a dog would feel it necessary to explain
that he turns thrice before lying down,
simply because his wolfish ancestor did so in order
to make a bed in the grass.</p>

<p>In this environment of ancient custom, however,
the American is surprised to find the most
up-to-date courts in the world and an administration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
of law which is so prompt, so colloquial,
so simple, so free from formality and so thoroughly
in touch with the ordinary man's every-day
life, as to provoke a blush for the tribunals
of the vaunted New World, still lagging in their
archaic conventionality and their diffuse and dilatory
methods.</p>

<p>At home, the American has been perplexed by
the threadbare assertion that we have as many
judges in a large city as has all England, but he
shortly learns that such comparison considers
only the few judges of the High Court, and
ignores the others and the officials performing
judicial functions, so numerous that the
little Island fairly teems with its justiciary and
that the implied criticism is due to ignorance of
the facts.</p>

<p>The trials, both civil and criminal, will reveal
the complete triumph of common sense and the
Englishman will appear at his best in his court,
for there he leads the world. The hearty good
humor, alacrity and crispness of the proceedings,
the absence of declamation but the avoidance
of monotony by the proper distribution of
emphasis, all combine to delight the practised observer.</p>

<p>The disciplining of the profession by means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
a body to whom may be privately submitted
questions of morals and manners, mostly solved
by gentle admonition and rarely by severe action,
will suggest that our single punishment&mdash;disbarment&mdash;is
so drastic as rarely to be invoked
and hence largely fails as a corrective.</p>

<p>From the "bobby" in the street, to the Lord
Chancellor on the Woolsack, from a hearing by
a registrar to collect a petty debt, to the donning
of the black cap in order to sentence a murderer;
all will prove suggestive to the alert
American who will nevertheless depart with a
feeling that, while there is room for improvement
at home, yet, upon the whole, there is much
of which to be proud in our administration of
the sound old law of our ancestors.</p>

<p>The kindly aid of a number of English judges,
barristers and solicitors, by way of suggestion
and criticism, is gratefully acknowledged.</p>

<p>The occasional illustrations are photographic
reproductions of original oil sketches.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>


<p>In accordance with the kind suggestions of a
well-known barrister, a number of corrections
have been adopted in the text of this edition.
Some of them it had been the intention of the
Author to make before his death and others have
seemed necessary in order to secure greater accuracy
and to preserve the value of the book for
purposes of reference.</p>

IN THE LONDON COURTS</h2>

<h3>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h3>

<blockquote><p>THE LAW COURTS BUILDING ON THE STRAND&mdash;A
COURT ROOM&mdash;PARTICIPANTS IN A
TRIAL&mdash;WIGS AND GOWNS&mdash;COLLOQUIAL
METHODS&mdash;AGREEABLE VOICES&mdash;SIMILARITY
TO AMERICAN TRIALS.</p></blockquote>


<p>Leaving the busy Strand at Temple Bar and
entering the Law Courts Building, one plunges
into that teeming hive where the disputes of millions
of British subjects are settled by law. Here
the whole kingdom begins and ends its legal
battles&mdash;except the cases on circuit, those minor
matters which go to the County Courts, and the
very few which reach the House of Lords.</p>

<p>The visitor, strolling through the lofty Gothic
hall and ascending one of the stair-cases to the
second floor, finds himself in a long, vaulted corridor,
sombre and quiet, which runs around the
building. There are no idle crowds and there is
no smoking, but, curiously enough, frequent refreshment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bars occupy corners, where drink as
well as food is dispensed by vivacious bar-maids.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Here and there, a uniformed officer guards a
curtained door through which may be had a
glimpse of a court room; but no sound escapes,
because of a second door of glass, also draped
with curtains. Groups of litigants and witnesses
await their turns or emerge with flushed faces
and discuss their recent experiences before returning
to the roar of London. Barristers pace
up and down in wig and gown, or retire to a
window-seat for conference with their respective
solicitors.</p>

<p>A mere sight-seer, having thus visited the
courts, passes on his way, but as the administration
of law, from the Lord Chancellor to the
"bobby," is the thing best done in England and
commands the admiration and imitation of the
world, the courts deserve more than a casual visit.</p>

<p>Passing the officer and the double-curtained
doors, one enters the court-room, which is usually
small and lofty, with gray stone walls
panelled in oak, subdued in color and well lighted
from above. The admirable arrangement of
seats sloping steeply upward on all sides, instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of resting upon a level floor, brings the
heads of speakers and auditors near together;
and the bright colors of the judges' robes&mdash;scarlet
with a blue sash over the shoulder in the case
of the Lord Chief Justice, and blue with a scarlet
sash in the case of most of the others, together
with various modifications of broad yellow
cuffs&mdash;first strike the eye.</p>

<p>The judge's bewigged head, as he sits behind
his desk, is about twelve feet above the floor. On
his left, at the same level, stands the witness,
who has reached the box by a small stairway.
At the judge's right are the jury, seated in a
box of either two rows of six or three rows of
four, the back row being nearly on a level with
the judge. In front of the judge, but so much
lower as to oblige him to stand on his chair when
whispering to his lordship, sits his "associate,"
a barrister in wig and gown, whom we should
designate as the clerk of the court.</p>

<p>Facing the associate is the "solicitors' well,"
at the floor level, where, on the front row of
benches, sit the solicitors in ordinary street dress.
Then come the barristers&mdash;all in wig and gown&mdash;seated
on wooden benches, each row with a
narrow desk which forms the back of the seat
in front. The desks are supplied with ink wells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and with the inevitable quill pen. The barristers
keep their places until their cases are reached
and then try them from the same seats, so that
there is always a considerable professional audience.
For the public there is little accommodation&mdash;usually
only a few benches back of the
barristers and a meagre gallery above.</p>

<p>The solicitor, whose client may be the plaintiff
or the defendant, has prepared the case and
knows its ins and outs as well as the personal
peculiarities of the parties and witnesses who
will be called, but he is unable to take any part
in the trial and can only whisper an occasional
suggestion to the barristers he has retained, by
craning his neck backward to the leader behind
him. This leader is a newcomer into the case.
He is a K. C. (King's Counsel) who has been
"retained" by the solicitor upon payment of a
guinea followed by a large "agreed fee," and he
leaves the "opening of the pleadings" to the
junior immediately back of him, while the latter,
in turn, has handed over the preparation to his
"devil" who is seated behind him.</p>

<p>Thus, the four men engaged on a side, instead
of being grouped around a counsel table, as in
America, are seated one in front of the other
at different levels, rendering a general consultation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
difficult when questions suddenly arise.
The two men on each side of the case who know
most about it have no voice in court, for the devil
is necessarily as mum as the solicitor, and the
name of the former does not even appear in the
subsequent report of the trial. How this comes
about requires some acquaintance with the different
fields of activity of barristers and solicitors,
which will be referred to later.</p>

<p>In thus glancing at an English court, an
American's attention is sure to be arrested by
the wig. The barrister's wig, for his ordinary
practice in the High Court, has a mass of white
hair standing straight up from the forehead, as
a German brushes his; above the ears are three
horizontal, stiff curls, and, back of the ears, four
more, while behind there are five, finished by
the queue which is divided into tails, reaching
below the collar of the gown. There are bright,
shiny, well-curled wigs; wigs old, musty, tangled
and out of curl; some are worn jauntily, producing
a smart and sporty effect, others look like
extinguishers. So grotesque is the effect that it
is difficult to realize that these men are not mummers
in some pageant of modern London, but
that they are serious participants in grave proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Not only the eye, but the ear will convey novel
and favorable impressions to the observer. He
will be struck by the cheerful alacrity and
promptness of the witnesses, by the quickness
and fulness of their responses, by a certain atmosphere
of complete understanding between
court, counsel, witnesses and jury, and more
than all, by the marked courtesy, combined with
an absence of all restraint, and a perfectly colloquial
and good-humored interchange of
thought. It is hard to define this, but it certainly
differs from the air of an American tribunal
where the participants seem almost sulky
by comparison. The Englishman in his court is
evidently in his native element and appears at
his best.</p>

<p>The voices, too, are most agreeable, although
many barristers acquire the high-pitched, thin
tone usually associated with literary and ecclesiastical
surroundings. Besides superior modulation,
the chief merit is in the admirable distribution
of emphasis. In this respect both the dialogue
and monologue in an English court room
are far less monotonous than in an American.</p>

<p>Passing the superficial impression and coming
to the underlying substance, there is extraordinarily
little difference between law courts on
both sides of the Atlantic. Not only is the common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
law the same, and the legislation of the
two countries largely parallel, but the method
of law-thought&mdash;the manner of approaching the
consideration of questions&mdash;is precisely identical,
so that, upon the whole, the diversity is no
greater than that which may exist between any
two of the forty-six states. Indeed, so complete
is the similarity that an American lawyer
feels that he might step into the barristers'
benches and conduct a current case without causing
the slightest hitch in the proceedings, provided
he could manage the wig and that the difference
of accent&mdash;not very marked in men of
the profession&mdash;should not attract too much attention.</p>

<p>That the law emanating from the little Island,
which could be tucked away in a corner of some
of our States, should have spread over the vast
territory of America and control such an enormous
population with its many foreign strains,
and that, as the decades roll on, it should thrive,
improve, and successfully grapple with problems
never dreamed of in its origin, indicates its surprising
vitality and stimulates interest in the
methods now in vogue in its native land.</p>

<h3>THE MAKING OF LAWYERS</h3>

<blockquote><p>CLASSES FROM WHICH BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS
ARE DRAWN&mdash;THE INNS OF
COURT&mdash;INNS OF CHANCERY&mdash;STUDENTS
AT PERIOD OF REVOLUTION&mdash;A BARRISTER'S
CHAMBERS&mdash;TRAINING OF BARRISTERS
IN AN INN&mdash;BEING CALLED TO THE
BAR&mdash;TRAINING OF SOLICITORS.</p></blockquote>


<p>To young Englishmen possessing neither fortune
nor influence, the profession of the law has
long been an open road to advancement in a
country notable for orderly and constitutional
methods, where the ultimate appeal is always to
reason. Perhaps the worship of money, which
characterizes modern England, has somewhat
lessened the prestige of success at the Bar there,
as it has done in America, where a millionaire,
upon urging his son to enter the profession, was
met by the young hopeful's reply: "Pooh, father,
<i>we</i> can hire lawyers." Nevertheless, the law still
draws its recruits from the flower of the youth of
both countries and, in England, it appeals to two
types of men: to those who would become barristers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and to those whose ambition soars no higher
than the solicitor's calling; moreover the classes
from which the candidates are generally drawn,
differ as do their training and the future functions.</p>

<p>Traditionally, indeed, the sons of gentlemen
and the younger sons of peers were restricted,
when seeking an occupation, to the Army, the
Navy, the Church and the Bar. They never became
solicitors, for that branch, like the profession
of medicine, was somewhat arbitrarily excluded
from possible callings, but this tradition,
as is the case with many others, has been gradually
losing its force of late years. It must always
have been a little hazy in its application, owing
to the difficulty of ascertaining accurately the
status of the parent, if not a peer; and Sir
Thomas Smith who, more than three centuries
ago, after describing the various higher titles, attempted
a definition of the word "gentleman,"
could formulate nothing more definite than the
following: "As for gentlemen they be made
good cheap in this kingdom; for whosoever
studieth the laws of the realm, who studieth in
the universities, who professeth the liberal
sciences, and, to be short, who can live idly and
without manual labor, and will bear the port,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
charge and countenance of a gentleman, he shall
be called master and shall be taken for a gentleman."
The ancient books, too, afford a glimpse
of a struggle on the part of the Bar to demand
a certain aristocratic deference, for an old case
is reported where the court refused to hear an
affidavit because a barrister named in it was not
called an "Esquire."</p>

<p>That the struggle was not in vain, is evidenced
by the reply of an old-time Lord Chancellor,
who, when asked how he made his selection from
the ranks of the barristers when obliged to name
a new judge, answered: "I always appoint a
gentleman and if he knows a little law, so much
the better."</p>

<p>Naturally, the solicitor (who was formerly
styled an attorney, except when practicing in
an equity court) was sensitive about his own
position, for the passage of a now-forgotten
Act of Parliament was once procured, decreeing
that attorneys should thereafter be denominated
as "gentlemen."</p>

<p>But times have changed in the law, as in other
fields of activity, and sons of good families, as
well as those of less degree, now enter both
branches of the profession. Hence, representatives
of the best names in England are to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
found on the barristers' benches side by side with
self-made men, some of whom have become
ornaments of the Bar, and with men of divers
races, such as swarthy East Indians, and Dutch
South Africans. One or two barristers may
even be found, who, although members of the
Bar and necessarily of one of the Inns, nevertheless,
remain, as born, American citizens. The
Bar, in short, although a jealously close and exclusive
organization, has become a less aristocratic
body and is now a real republic where
brains and character count.</p>

<p>The same diversity of origin exists amongst
the solicitors, for, as has been stated, they are
now, in part, recruited from those who formerly
would have condescended to nothing less than
the Bar. A constant improvement in training,
too, in the promulgation of rules of professional
conduct, in the enforcement of a firm discipline
and in the nursing of traditions, all tend to raise
and maintain a higher standard and a better
tone than formerly existed in the ranks of the
solicitors. Thus, the modern tendency is that
there should be less difference in the personnel
of those entering either branch of the profession.</p>

<p>Candidates for the Bar are mostly University
men, more mature in years, perhaps, than our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
graduates&mdash;for boys commence and end their
college courses late in England&mdash;and they are,
as a rule, more broadly cultivated than those
who intend to become solicitors. Some, indeed,
take a full course of theoretical law at Oxford
or Cambridge before beginning practical training
as a student in one of the Inns of Court,
which are peculiarly British institutions, having
no counterpart elsewhere.</p>

<p>Physically, an Inn of Court is not a single
edifice, nor even an enclosure. It is rather an
ill-defined district in which graceful but dingy
buildings of diverse pattern and of various degrees
of antiquity, are closely grouped together
and through which wind crooked lanes, mostly
closed to traffic, but available for pedestrians.
Unexpected open squares, refreshed by fountains,
delight the eye, the whole affording the
most peaceful quietude, despite the nearness of
the roar of surrounding London. The four Inns
of Court (as distinguished from the Inns of
Chancery and Serjeants' Inn, all of which have
ceased to exist) are, the Middle Temple, the Inner
Temple, Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, but
the last is of minor importance in these modern
days, having fallen out of fashion.</p>

<p>The Middle Temple and the Inner Temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
acquired, by lease in the XIV Century, and
by actual purchase in 1609, the lands of the
Knights Templar, consisting of many broad
acres situated on the south side of the Strand
and Fleet Street, opposite the present Law
Courts Building, and the whole space is now
occupied by an intricate mass of structures&mdash;the
great Halls, the Libraries, the quaint barristers'
chambers&mdash;and by the beautiful Temple
Gardens, sloping to the Thames, adorned with
bright flowers and shaded by fine trees. There
is no line of demarcation between the two
Temples&mdash;one simply melts into the other.
They own in common the Temple Church, part
of which dates from 1185, with its recumbent
black marble figures of Knights in full armor
and, in the churchyard, its tomb of Oliver Goldsmith.</p>

<p>The wonderful Hall of the Middle Temple,
where the benchers, barristers and students
still eat their stated dinners, was built about
1572, and is celebrated for its interior, especially
for the open-work ceiling of ancient oak.
Shakespeare's comedy, Twelfth Night, was performed
in the Hall in 1601, and it is believed
that one of the actors was the author himself.
The Library is a great one, but an American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lawyer may be surprised at the incompleteness
of the collection of American authorities.
The Hall of the Inner Temple, on the other
hand, is quite modern, although most imposing
and in the best of taste.</p>

<p>Lincoln's Inn became possessed about 1312
of what was once the country-seat of the Earl of
Lincoln, which, running along Chancery Lane,
adjoins the modern Law Courts Building on the
north and consists of two large, open squares
surrounded by rows of ancient dwellings, long
since converted into barristers' chambers, and
shady walks leading to a fine Hall of no great
antiquity, however. An old gateway, with the
arms of the Lincolns and a date, A. D. 1518, is
considered a good example of red brick-work
of a Gothic type&mdash;probably the only one left in
London. The Library, which has been growing
for over four hundred years, contains the most
complete collection of books upon law and kindred
subjects in England, numbering upward
of 40,000 volumes.</p>

<p>These three Inns of Court are the active institutions;
the fourth, Gray's Inn, which probably
took its name from the Greys of Wilton
who formerly owned its site, has long since
ceased to be of much importance, although the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
old Hall and the classic architecture of some of
the Chambers, still attracts the eye. It happens,
however, that a Philadelphia student, who attended
this ancient Inn nearly two hundred years
ago, was responsible for the phrase still proverbial
on both sides of the Atlantic, "that's a
case for a Philadelphia lawyer." The unpopular
Royal judges of the Province of New York
had, in 1734, indicted a newspaper publisher for
libel in criticising the court and they threatened
to disbar any lawyer of the Province who might
venture to defend him. But, from the then distant
little town on the Delaware, the former
student of Gray's Inn, although an old man at
the time, journeyed to Albany and, by his skill
and vehemence, actually procured a verdict of
acquittal from the jury under the very noses of
the obnoxious court; the fame of which achievement
spread throughout not only the Colonies
but the mother-country itself.</p>

<p>Names great in the law, in literature, in statecraft
and in war are linked with each of these
venerable establishments, to record which would
mean to review much of the history of England
as well as of America; for, besides the early
Colonial students, a large number were entered
in the different Inns during the period immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
preceding the Revolution. Of these, South
Carolina sent forty-seven, Virginia twenty-one,
Maryland sixteen, Pennsylvania eleven, New
York five and New England two. The names
of many of them are later to be found amongst
the leaders of the Bar of the new country, on the
bench as Chief Justices and even as signers of the
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>The Halls of the Inns were once the scenes
of masques and revels, triumphs and other mad
orgies, in which the benchers, barristers and
students took part; including, as mentioned, the
production of Shakespeare's plays during his
lifetime.</p>

<p>In these halls also occur the stated dinners&mdash;to
which, in the Temple, at least, the porter's
horn still summons. The members and students
of the Inn, arrayed in gowns, attend in procession
and, entering the hall, seat themselves
on long benches before oaken tables; the governing
body&mdash;the benchers&mdash;being placed at one
end where the floor is elevated. It is pleasant
to record that, during the last year or two, the
daily contact of the barrister with his Inn has
been increased by the innovation of a luncheon
which is served in the hall at the hour when the
courts take a recess. On this occasion the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
noted English advocates may be seen, strolling
in without removing their silk hats, sometimes
without even having dispensed with wig and
gown, when, seating themselves on the uncompromising
oak, they call for a chop and
beer and relax into jolly sociability.</p>

<p>At one time barristers actually lived in the
Inns of Court, but this practically ceased about
the time of the reign of Elizabeth. All of them
now have their "chambers" in the obsolete little
dwelling houses, facing upon the open squares
or narrow lanes of the Inns, which are merely
offices, but very unlike those of an American lawyer
in one of our "skyscrapers."</p>

<p>Entering the front door by a low step, or
climbing two or three flights of a rickety staircase
in one of these houses, the visitor finds a
door on which, or on a tin sign, are painted the
names of one or more gentlemen, without stating
their occupations, which would be superfluous
in this small world of barristers. A summons
by means of the old iron knocker, discloses the
barrister's clerk, whose habitat is an outer room,
and whose business it is to receive visitors&mdash;perchance
the clerks of solicitors with briefs and
fees.</p>

<p>Ushered into the barrister's sanctum, one finds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a meagrely furnished room, the walls masked
with rows of books, the table, chairs and window-sills
littered with papers. Amidst all this,
a modern telephone looks quite out of place,
and the American tries to avoid detection when
his eye unconsciously steals to a wig hanging on
a hook back of the barrister's chair and to a
round tin box, lying on the floor, which is for
the transportation of the tonsorial armor when
its owner travels on circuit. The otherwise uninviting
aspect of the place is redeemed, however,
by a cheerful fire blazing on the hearth and
by a restful outlook upon a shady garden, and a
splashing fountain, where the sparrows sip the
water and take their dainty baths. Here the
barrister remains when not in court; but when
the day's work is done, if he be prosperous, his
motor car whisks him to the more elegant surroundings
of a home in the West End, or, perhaps
a humble bus and suburban train carry him
far from town.</p>

<p>The Inns of Court began their existence about
1400, nearly cotemporaneously with the Trade
Guilds, and both, doubtless, took their rise from
the instinct of men engaged in a common occupation
to combine for mutual protection. All
lawyers were once men in holy orders and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
judges were bishops, abbots and other Church
dignitaries, but in the XIII Century the clergy
were forbidden to act in the courts and, thereupon,
the students of the law gathered together
and formed the Inns. Much concerning their
origin is obscure, but the nucleus of each was
doubtless the gravitation of scholars to some ancient
hostelry, there to profit by the teachings
of a master lawyer of the day&mdash;just as the
modern London club had its beginning in the
convivialities of a casual coffee house. In time
these loose aggregations developed into strong
and elaborate organizations which acquired extensive
real property, now of enormous value,
and have long wielded a powerful influence.</p>

<p>In order to enjoy the quiet of what was then
the country, and yet to retain the advantage of
the city's protection at a time when rural localities
were far from safe, the Inns were mostly
located close to the west wall of the City, although
the Inner Temple, as its name implies,
is just within the line of that vanished wall, and
thus they were convenient to Westminster, where
the courts were permanently located by a provision
of Magna Charta. During the present
generation, however, the principal courts (except
the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the Privy Council) have returned to a
situation actually contiguous to the old Inns,
whilst the vast town, during the centuries, has
not only engulfed Westminster but has spread
miles beyond it. Thus, all the Inns were
grouped in a section, perhaps a square mile in
extent, bounded on the east by Chancery Lane,
which roughly follows the old City wall and between
the Thames on the south, and the district
called Holborn on the north.</p>

<p>Looking now to the functions of these ancient
institutions, an Inn of Court may be defined as
an unincorporated society of barristers, which,
originating about the end of the XIII Century,
possesses by immemorial custom the exclusive
privilege of calling candidates to the Bar, and
of disciplining, or when necessary, of disbarring
barristers.</p>

<p>The governing body is composed of the
benchers, who are either Judges or King's Counsel
and prominent junior barristers, but it is usual
to invite a member to join the benchers of his Inn
when, and only when, a vacancy occurs. The
executive officer is the treasurer, who is selected
annually, and the members consist of the barristers
and students.</p>

<p>All the Inns are alike in authority, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the privileges which they enjoy and the regulations
of each, governing the admission, education
and examination of students and the
calling to the Bar of those who are qualified, are
precisely uniform; any differences which may
have existed having been abolished by the adoption
in 1875 of a code of rules known as the
"Consolidated Regulations." While there is
thus complete equality and no official precedence,
yet each Inn has its own history, traditions and
ancient customs. The choice of which Inn to
enter, thus becomes a matter of individual preference,
depending upon sentiment, or upon family
or social surroundings.</p>

<p>The former Inns of Chancery should also be
mentioned before leaving the subject, although
they have no present interest for the modern
lawyer. Their origin, too, is buried in obscurity,
but they arose about the same time as the
Inns of Court, with one of which each was connected,
and were at first places of preparatory
training for young students later to be admitted
to the particular Inn. These youthful apprentices,
however, were gradually ousted by the attorneys
and solicitors&mdash;who have always been
excluded from the Inns of Court&mdash;whereupon
the Inns of Chancery fell out of fashion and deteriorated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
so that by the middle of the Eighteenth
Century they had disappeared and their
names are now mere memories. During the
period of activity of the Inns of Chancery,
Staple Inn (perhaps the best known) and Barnard's
Inn, were attached to Gray's Inn; Clifford's
Inn, Clement's Inn and Lyon's Inn were
intimately related to the Inner Temple; Furnival's
Inn and Thavie's Inn to Lincoln's Inn;
the New Inn and Strand Inn to the Middle
Temple. One block only of quaint Elizabethan
buildings, with gables of cross timber and plaster,
still overhangs the great thoroughfare of
Holborn and marks what is left of Staple Inn.</p>

<p>Likewise Serjeants' Inn vanished in 1876,
when its valuable realty was sold&mdash;for Serjeants-at-law
had long ceased to be created&mdash;and the
proceeds were divided amongst the few survivors;
a proceeding much criticized at the time,
although one of them gave his share to charity.
The serjeants-at-law were once a class of barristers
who had in some manner acquired the
exclusive right of audience in the Court of Common
Pleas and had also secured a monopoly of
the then profitable art of pleading. Upon attaining
this degree, a serjeant severed his relations
with his Inn of Court and attached himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to the Serjeants' Inn. After having
occupied several sites since the Sixteenth Century,
Serjeants' Inn was finally located on
Chancery Lane, and to it belonged all of the
Serjeants, and all of the judges of the Common
Law Courts, for they, necessarily, had been serjeants
before being elevated to the bench. The
buildings, which are small and have no pretensions
to architectural beauty, have for many years
been occupied as offices, chiefly those of solicitors.</p>

<p>Thus, of the many Inns of Chancery, of the
Serjeants' Inn (and the once powerful societies
which they housed), there remain none but the
four great Inns of Court, through one of which
must pass every barrister called to the English
Bar.</p>

<p>This brief sketch may convey some idea of the
extent to which the young law student unconsciously
absorbs tradition, and is moulded, when
plastic, by the pressure of centuries of custom
and etiquette. Whatever may have been his forebears,
he is more than likely, when turned out
as a full-fledged barrister, to answer pretty
nearly to the old definition, for he has, indeed,
been one "who studieth the laws of the realm"
and he is apt to "bear the port, charge and countenance
of a gentleman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
To the embryo barrister, however, the existing
Inns possess interests far livelier than those
referred to, for he must enter one of them, and
not only thus gain access to the Bar, but must
ally himself to his choice unless he elects, by
going through certain formalities, to emigrate
to another Inn. Formerly he had only to attend
a single function&mdash;a dinner&mdash;during each term
and, having "eaten twelve dinners," he, ipso
facto, became entitled to be called to the Bar, no
matter how inadequate might be his knowledge
of the law. In these less aristocratic and more
prosaic days, however, he is obliged diligently to
apply himself to study, and to pass, from time to
time, regular and strict examinations, prescribed
by the Council of Legal Education, so that his
equipment is no longer left to chance, but is
really measured with cold accuracy. The term
of study is not less than three years, and twelve
terms, four in each year, must be "kept" at the
Inn, the evidence of which is still the fact of
dining in the hall six days during each term,
although members of the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge need dine but three days in each
term.</p>

<p>An English student's reading is much like
that pursued in one of our own law schools, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
chief difference being that he devotes more time
to mastering general principles than to the consideration
of reported cases from which our students
are presumed to extract the underlying
principle. Much has been said in favor of each
method, and the true course probably lies between
the extremes, but the average result of an
English law training, superimposed upon a generally
superior prior education, is perhaps somewhat
better than the average American result, while,
as to the few on both sides of the water destined
to attain real eminence, no superiority could
fairly be claimed by either.</p>

<p>The total fees payable by a student amount
to about £140. and women, be it observed by
progressive ladies, are not eligible for the Bar in
England.</p>

<p>Having passed the necessary examinations,
the young barrister is finally "called to the Bar,"
a ceremony which takes place in the Hall of his
Inn, at the close of dinner on "Grand Day,"
which is the day appointed for a banquet, to
which a score or more of distinguished guests are
invited by the "Treasurer and the Masters of
the Bench." The Students, wearing gowns over
evening dress, are grouped together, below the
dais on which the benchers' table stands. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Steward of the Inn calls out the names in order
of seniority. Each Student, as his name is called,
advances to the high table and halts there, facing
the Treasurer, who, standing up, says to him:
"Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, by the authority and on behalf of the
Masters of the Bench, I publish you a barrister
of this Honorable Society." Then the Treasurer
shakes hands with the new barrister
and the latter walks away to join his comrades.</p>

<p>Solicitors are created by entirely different
methods, as there are no Inns nor any similar
organizations for students. There is a preliminary
examination to determine whether the boy
who desires to become a solicitor, has sufficient
general education. If so, he is apprenticed, for
a period of five years, to some practitioner, for
which privilege he pays a sum of money, say
from 100 to 400 guineas; the amount chiefly
depending upon the solicitor's standing.
There are official fees, too, amounting to
about £130, so that, as he receives no
compensation during his five years' apprenticeship,
and meantime must be supported
by his people, the cost of entering the solicitor's
calling is not inconsiderable. He begins
by copying papers and performing minor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
services in the public offices and, at the same
time, pursues his legal studies, which have steadily
become more arduous. His progress as a
law student is ascertained by an intermediate
examination, held under the direction of the
Solicitors' Incorporated Law Society, and a final
one determines whether he has acquired sufficient
knowledge of the law to be admitted to
practice. If shown to be qualified, he is admitted
by the courts, and is thereafter subject to the
discipline of the Society and to that of the
courts themselves, usually prompted by the Society.
The marked difference, therefore, that
distinguishes the solicitor's training from that of
the barrister, is the absence of any Inn of Court&mdash;with
its <i>esprit de corps</i>&mdash;as a commanding influence
in shaping his development and governing
his whole career. Nevertheless, while the
whole body of solicitors is, perhaps, not as liberally
educated nor as polished as the Bar, the
higher grade of solicitors are lawyers quite as
well equipped, and gentlemen equally accomplished,
as members of the Bar itself.</p>

<p>Some glimpses of the separate roads which the
barrister and the solicitor travel after their student

<h3>BARRISTERS</h3>

<blockquote><p>WAITING FOR SOLICITORS AS CLIENTS&mdash;"DEVILLING"&mdash;JUNIORS&mdash;CONDUCT
OF A
TRIAL&mdash;"TAKING SILK"&mdash;BECOMING A K. C.&mdash;ACTIVE
PRACTICE&mdash;THE SMALL NUMBER OF BARRISTERS.</p></blockquote>


<p>Having been called to the Bar, the question
first confronting the young barrister is whether
he really intends to practice. He may have read
law as an education, meaning to devote himself
to literature, to politics or to some other pursuit,
or he may have embraced the profession in deference
to the wishes of his family and to fill in the
time while awaiting the inheritance of property.
Supposing him, however, to be one of the minority
determined to rise in the profession, he is
confronted with formidable obstacles, for he
can not look to his friends to furnish him with
briefs. He can never be consulted nor retained
by the litigants themselves. The only clients
he can ever have are solicitors, whose clients, in
turn, are the public. He never goes beyond his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dingy chambers in the Inns of Court, where,
guarded by his clerk, he either wearily waits for
solicitors with briefs and fees, or, more likely
still, gives it up and goes fishing, shooting or
hunting. And this furnishes the market for
the alluring placards one sees at the old wig-makers'
shops in the Inns of Court: "Name up
and letters forwarded for £5 per annum."</p>

<p>The early ambition of the young barrister is
to become a "devil" to some junior barrister, who
always has recourse to such an understudy, and,
if the junior is making over £1,000 a year, he
continuously employs the same devil. This term
is not applied in a jocular sense, but is the
regular and serious appellation of a young barrister
who, in wig and gown, thus serves without
compensation and without fame&mdash;for his
name never appears&mdash;often for from five to
seven years. The devil studies the case, sees the
witnesses, looks up the law and generally masters
all the details, in order to supply the junior with
ammunition.</p>

<p>Before the trial the junior has one or more
"conferences" with the solicitor, all paid for at
so many guineas; occasionally he even sees the
party he is to represent, and, more rarely, an
important witness or two. The devil is sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
present, although his existence is, as a
rule, decorously concealed from the solicitor.</p>

<p>If the solicitor, or the litigating party, grows
nervous, or hears that the other side has employed
more distinguished counsel, the solicitor
retains a K. C. as leader. Then a "consultation"
ensues at the leader's chambers between the
leader, junior, solicitor, and, occasionally, the
devil.</p>

<p>At the trial, the junior merely "opens the pleadings"
by stating in the fewest possible words,
what the action is about&mdash;that it is, perhaps, a
suit for breach of promise of marriage between
Smith and Jones, or to recover upon an insurance
policy for a loss by fire&mdash;and then resumes
his seat, whereupon the leader&mdash;the great K. C.&mdash;really
opens the case, at considerable length
and with much more detail and argument than
would be good form in an American court. He
states his side's contention with particularity,
reads documents and correspondence (none of
which have to be proved unless their authenticity
is disputed&mdash;points which the solicitors have
long ago threshed out) and he even indicates the
position of the other side, while, at the same time,
arguing its fallacy. Having done this, he leaves
it to the junior to call the witnesses&mdash;more often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he departs from the court room to begin
another case elsewhere, and returns only to cross-examine
an important witness on the other side,
or to make the closing speech to the jury. In
this way a busy leader may have several trials
going on at once. The junior then proceeds to
examine the witnesses with the help of an occasional
whispered suggestion from the solicitor,
who is more than ever isolated by the departure
of the leader, and the devil is proud when the
junior audibly refers to him for some detail.</p>

<p>If the leader is absent, which frequently happens
notwithstanding his fee has been paid, inasmuch
as no case is deferred by reason of counsel's
absence, the junior takes his place, while
the solicitor grumbles and more devolves upon
the devil.</p>

<p>Occasionally, indeed, both leader and junior
may be elsewhere and then is the glorious opportunity
of the poor devil, who hungers for
such an accident, for he may open, examine, and
cross-examine, and, if neither his junior nor his
august leader appear, he may even close to the
jury. The solicitor will be white with rage and
chagrin, wondering how he shall explain to the
litigant the absence of the counsel whose fees
he has paid, but the devil may win and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
please the solicitor that the next time he may
himself be briefed as junior. This is one of
the things he has read of in the Lives of the
Lord Chancellors.</p>

<p>The devil is in no sense an employee or personal
associate of the junior&mdash;which might look
like partnership, a thing too abhorrent to be
permitted. On the contrary, he often has his
own chambers and may, at any time, be himself
retained as a junior, in which event his business
takes precedence of his duties as a devil,
and he then describes himself as being "on his
own."</p>

<p>Having gained some identity, and more or less
business "on his own" from the solicitors, a devil
gradually begins to shine as a junior, whereupon
appears his own satellite in the person of a
younger man as devil, while the junior becomes
more and more absorbed in the engrossing but
ever fascinating activities of regular practice at
the Bar.</p>

<p>Reaching a certain degree of prominence,
a junior at the common-law Bar may next
"take silk;" that is, become a K. C., or
King's Counsel, which has its counterpart at
the Chancery Bar, as will be explained later
when dealing with the division between the law
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and equity sides of the system. Whether a barrister
shall "apply" for silk is optional with himself
and the distinction is granted by the Lord
Chancellor, at his discretion, to a limited, but not
numerically defined, number of distinguished
barristers. The phrase is derived from the fact
that the K. C.'s gown is made of silk instead of
"stuff," or cotton. It has also a broad collar,
whereas the stuff gown is suspended from shoulder
to shoulder.</p>

<p>Whether or not to "take silk," or to become a
"leader," is a critical question in the career of any
successful common law or chancery barrister.
As a junior, he has acquired a paying practice,
as his fee is always two-thirds that of the leader.
He has also a comfortable chamber practice in
giving opinions, drawing pleadings and the like,
but all this must be abandoned&mdash;because the etiquette
of the Bar does not permit a K. C. or
leader to do a junior's work&mdash;and he must thereafter
hazard the fitful fancy of the solicitors
when selecting counsel in important causes.
Some have taken silk to their sorrow, and many
strong men remain juniors all their lives, trying
cases with K. C.'s much younger than themselves
as their leaders.</p>

<p>They tell this story in London: A certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Scotch law reporter (recently dead), noted for
his shrewdness and good judgment, having been
consulted by a barrister whether to "apply for
silk," advised him in the negative, but declined to
go into particulars. The barrister renewed his
inquiry more than once, finally demanding the
Scot's reason for his advice. The latter reluctantly
explained that the barrister had a good living
practice which he would be foolish to give up.
Being further pressed, he finally said: "In many
years' observation of the Bar I have learned that
success is only possible with one or more of three
qualifications, that is, a commanding person, a
fine voice, or great ability, and I rate their importance
in the order named. Now, with your
wretched physique, penny-trumpet voice, and
mediocre capacity, I think you would surely
starve to death." The barrister did not "apply,"
but never spoke to the Scotchman again.</p>

<p>The anecdote illustrates the crucial nature of
the step when taken by any barrister, and even if
taken with success, yet there are waves of popularity
affecting a leader's vogue. Solicitors get
vague notions that the sun of a given K. C. is rising
or setting&mdash;that the judges are looking at
him more kindly or less so, therefore K. C.'s and
leaders who were once overwhelmed with business,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
may sometimes be seen on the front row
with few briefs.</p>

<p>A successful K. C. leads a strenuous life, as
may well be appreciated if he be so good as to
take his American friend about with him in his
daily work, seating him with the barristers while
he is actually engaged. One very eminent K. C.,
who is also in Parliament, rises in term time at
4 a.m., and reads his briefs for the day's work
until 9, when he breakfasts and drives to chambers.
Slipping on wig and gown at chambers and
crossing the Strand, or arraying himself in the
robing room of the Law Courts, he enters court
at 10:30, and takes part in the trial or argument
of various cases until 4 o'clock, often having two
or three in progress at once, which require him to
step from court to court, to open, cross-examine,
or close, having relied upon the juniors and solicitors
to keep each case going and tell him the situation
when he enters to take a hand. From 4 to
6:30 he has consultations at his chambers, at intervals
of fifteen minutes, after which he drives
to the House of Commons, where he sits until
8:30, when it is time for dinner. If there is an
important debate, he returns to the House, but
tries to retire at midnight for four hours' sleep.
Naturally the Long Vacation alone makes such a
life possible for even the strongest man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>His success, however, means much, for there lie before
him great pecuniary rewards, fame, perhaps
a judgeship, or possibly an attorney-generalship,
both of which, unlike their prototypes in
America, mean very high compensation, to say
nothing of the honor and the title which usually
accompany such offices.</p>

<p>The English Bar is small and the business
very concentrated, but no statistics are available,
for many are called who never practice. By considering
the estimates of well-informed judges,
barristers and solicitors, it seems that the legal
business of the Kingdom is handled by so small
a number as from 500 to 800 barristers, although
the roll of living men who have been called to the
Bar now includes 9,970 names.</p>

<p>We have no Bar with which to institute a comparison,
for each county of every State has its
own and all members of county Bars, practicing
in the appellate court of a State, constitute the
Bar of that State, which is a complete entity.
Great commercial centres have larger ones and
have more business than rural localities, but no
Bar in America is national like that of London.</p>

<p>It would be interesting, if it were possible, to
compare the proportion of the population of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
England, which pursues the law as a vocation,
with that of the United States, but no figures
exist for the purpose. The number of barristers
includes, as already stated, those who do not
practice, while an enumeration of the solicitors'
offices would exclude individual solicitors employed
by others, as will be explained hereafter.
The aggregate of these two uncertain elements,
however, would be about 27,000. The legal directories
give the names of something like 95,000
lawyers in America of whom about 27,000 appear
in fifteen large cities&mdash;New York, for example,
being credited with over 10,000, Chicago with
over 3,500 and San Francisco with about 1,500&mdash;leaving
about 69,000 in the smaller towns and
scattered throughout the land. These tentative,
and necessarily vague, suggestions rather indicate
that the proportion of lawyers may not be very
unequal in the two countries.</p>

<h3>BARRISTERS&mdash;THE COMMON LAW
AND THE CHANCERY BARS</h3>

<blockquote><p>BAR DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS&mdash;NO DISTINCTION

IN A PARTICULAR COURT&mdash;"GOING SPECIAL"&mdash;LIST
OF SPECIALS AND LEADERS&mdash;SIGNIFICANCE

COATS"&mdash;WIGS IN THE
HOUSE OF LORDS&mdash;BARRISTERS' BAGS,
BLUE AND RED.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Bar is divided into two separate parts&mdash;the
Common Law Bar and the Chancery Bar;
for a barrister does not try cases of both kinds as
in America. The solicitor knows whether he has
a law or equity case in hand, and takes it to the
appropriate barrister. Common law barristers
have their chambers chiefly in the Middle Temple
and Inner Temple; chancery men, largely
in Lincoln's Inn, and the two kinds of barristers
know little of, and seem even to have a kind of
contempt for, each other. Thus a common law
barrister passes his life in jury trials and appeals;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
whereas a chancery man knows nothing
but courts of equity, unless he follows a will case
into a jury trial as a colleague of a common law
man to determine an issue of <i>devisavit vel non</i>.
And there are further specializations&mdash;although
the divisions are not so marked&mdash;into probate,
divorce or admiralty men. Besides, there is
what is known as the Parliamentary Bar, practicing
entirely before Parliamentary committees,
boards and commissions. It is, however, curious
that in England no apparent distinction exists
between civil and criminal practice and common
law barristers accept both kinds of briefs indiscriminately.</p>

<p>At the Chancery Bar there is a peculiar subdivision
which has already been mentioned. Having
reached a certain degree of success and become
a K. C., a barrister may "take his seat" in
a particular court as a "leader" by notifying the
Judge and informing the other K. C.'s who are
already practising there. Thereafter he can
never go into another, except as a "special," a
term which will be explained presently. For
three pence, at any law stationer's, one can buy
a list of the leaders in the six chancery courts,
varying in number from three to five and aggregating
twenty-five, and if a solicitor wishes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
leader for his junior in any of these courts he
must retain one out of the limited list available
or pay the "special" fee. Hence, these gentlemen
sit like boys in school at their desks and try
the cases in which they have been retained as
they are reached in rotation.</p>

<p>But even for a leader at the Chancery Bar,
one more step is possible, a step which a barrister
may take, or not, as he pleases, and that is: he
may go "special." This means that he surrenders
his position as a leader in a particular court and
is open to accept retainers in any chancery court;
but his retainer, in addition to the regular brief
fee, must be at least fifty guineas or multiples of
that sum, and his subsequent fees in like proportion.
The printed list also shows the names of
these "specials," at present only five in number.
The list of leaders and specials in 1910 reads as
follows:

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
The dress of barristers is the same for the Common
Law Bar as for the Chancery Bar, but the
details of both gown and wig signify to the initiated
much as to the professional position of the
wearer. The difference between the junior's
stuff gown and the leader's silk one has already
been referred to, but it is not true that a barrister
having "taken silk," that is, having become a
K. C. or a leader, always wears a silk gown, for,
if he be in mourning, he again wears a cotton
gown, as he did in his junior days, but, to preserve
his distinction, he wears "weepers"&mdash;a six-inch
deep, white lawn cuff, the name and utility
of which originated before handkerchiefs were
invented. Moreover, when in mourning his
"bands"&mdash;the untied white lawn cravat, hanging
straight down, which all barristers wear&mdash;have
three lines of stitching instead of two. Under
his gown, a K. C. wears a "court coat," cut
not unlike an ordinary morning coat, though
with hooks and eyes instead of buttons, while
the junior wears the conventional frock coat. On
a hot day, a junior wearing a seersucker jacket
and carelessly allowing his gown to disclose it,
may receive an admonition from the court, whispered
in his ear by an officer.</p>

<p>Wigs, which were introduced in the courts in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
1670, and have long survived their disappearance
in private life, were formerly made of
human hair which became heavy and unsanitary
with repeated greasing. They required frequent
curling and dusting with powder which had a
tendency to settle on the gown and clothing.
About 1822, a wig-maker, who may be regarded
as a benefactor of the profession, invented the
modern article, composed of horse hair, in the
proportion of five white strands to one black; this
is so made as to retain its curl without grease,
and with but infrequent recurling, and it requires
no powder.</p>

<p>The wig worn by the barrister in his daily
practice has already been described, but, when
arguing a case in the House of Lords he has recourse
to an extraordinary head-dress, which is
precisely the shape of a half-bushel basket with
the front cut away to afford him light and air.
This, hanging below the shoulders, has an advantage
over the Lord Chancellor's wig in being
more roomy, so that the barrister's hand can steal
inside of it if he have occasion to scratch his head
at a knotty problem, whereas his Lordship, in
executing the same manoeuvre, inevitably sets
his awry and thereby adds to its ludicrous effect.</p>

<p>To the unaccustomed eye, the wig, at first, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a complete disguise. Individuality is lost in the
overpowering absurdity and similarity of the
heads. Then, too, there is an involuntary association
of gray hair with years, making the Bar
seem composed exclusively of old gentlemen of
identical pattern. The observer is somewhat in
the position of the Indian chiefs, who, having
been taken to a number of eastern cities in order
to be impressed with the white man's power,
recognized no difference between them&mdash;although
they could have detected, in the deepest forest,
traces of the passage of a single human being&mdash;and
reported upon returning to their tribes that
there was only one town, Washington, and that
they were merely trundled around in sleeping
cars and repeatedly brought back to the same
place.</p>

<p>By degrees, however, differences between individuals
emerge from this first impression.
Blond hair above a sunburned neck, peeping between
the tails of a queue, suggests the trout
stream and cricket field; or an ample cheek, not
quite masked by the bushel-basket-shaped wig,
together with a rotundity hardly concealed by the
folds of a gown, remind one that port still passes
repeatedly around English tables after dinner.
But it must be said that, while the wig may add
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to the uniformity and perhaps to the dignity&mdash;despite
a certain grotesqueness&mdash;of a court room,
yet it largely extinguishes individuality and
obliterates to some extent personal appearance
as a factor in estimating a man; and this is a
factor of no small importance, for every one, in
describing another, begins with his appearance&mdash;a
man's presence, pose, features and dress all go
to produce prepossessions which are subject to
revision upon further acquaintance. One thing
is certain, the wig is an anachronism which will
never be imported into America. For the Bar to
adopt the gown (as has been largely done by the
Bench throughout the country) would be quite
another matter and it seems to work well in Canada.
This would have the advantage of distinguishing
counsel from the crowd in a court room,
of covering over inappropriateness of dress and
it might promote the impressiveness of the tribunal.</p>

<p>The bag of an English barrister is also an
important part of his outfit. It is very large,
capable of holding his wig and gown, as well as
his briefs, and suggests a clothes bag. It is not
carried by the barrister himself, but it is borne
by his clerk. Its color has a deep significance.
Every young barrister starts with a <i>blue</i> bag and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
can only acquire a <i>red</i> one under certain conditions.
As devil, and as junior, it is not considered
<i>infra dig.</i> to carry his own bag and he has ever
before him the possibility of possessing a red bag.
At last he succeeds in impressing a venerable
K. C. by his industry and skill in some case,
whereupon one morning the clerk of the K. C.
appears at the junior's chambers bearing a <i>red</i>
bag with his initials embroidered upon it&mdash;a gift
from the great K. C. Thereafter he can use that
coveted color and he may be pardoned for having
his clerk follow him closely for awhile so there
may be no mistake as to the ownership. Custom
requires him to tip the K. C.'s clerk with a guinea
and further exacts that the clerk shall pay for
the bag, which costs nine shillings and sixpence,
thus, by this curious piece of economy, the clerk
nets the sum of eleven shillings and sixpence and
the K. C. is at no expense.</p>

<p>The line which separates solicitors from the
Bar&mdash;the barristers&mdash;is difficult for an American
to fully appreciate, for in our country it does not
exist. The solicitor, or attorney, is a man of law
business&mdash;not an advocate. A person contemplating
litigation must first go to a solicitor, who
guides his conduct by advice in the preliminary
stages, or occasionally retains a barrister to give
a written opinion upon a concrete question of law.
The solicitor conducts all the negotiations or
threats which usually precede a lawsuit and if
compromise is impossible he brings a suit and retains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a junior barrister by handing him a brief,
which consists of a written narrative of the controversy,
with copies of all papers and correspondence&mdash;in
short, the facts of the case&mdash;and
which states on its back the amount of the barrister's
fee. The brief is engrossed or type-written
on large-sized paper with very broad margins
for notes, and is folded only once and lengthwise
so as to make a packet fifteen by four inches.</p>

<p>All Englishmen of substance, and all firms
and corporations, have their regular solicitors
and the relation is frequently handed down from
generation to generation. It is, of course, unusual
except in large corporations to have a permanent
barrister, because the solicitor selects one
from time to time, as the occasion requires, and
the client is rarely even consulted in the choice.
When an Englishman speaks of his lawyer, he
always means his solicitor and if he wishes to impress
his auditor with the seriousness of his legal
troubles, he adds that his lawyer has been obliged
to take the advice of counsel&mdash;perhaps of a K. C.</p>

<p>Hence, the solicitor, unlike the barrister, is not
ambitious for fame, nor does he worry because
he can not become the Attorney-General or a
judge; his mind is intent upon the pounds, shillings
and pence of his calling. He may seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
business, which the barrister can not do, and he
is something of a banker, often a promoter. Some
solicitors, especially those practicing at Liverpool,
are admiralty men, others are adepts in the
organization of corporations and in litigation
arising concerning them and there are many
other specialties. Some are men of the highest
grade&mdash;particularly those employed by big companies
or by families with large estates.</p>

<p>The venerable family solicitor of the novel and
stage&mdash;that custodian of private estates and secrets
who appears in all domestic crises, warning
the wayward son, comforting the daughter whose
affections are misplaced and succoring the gambling
father, is sufficiently familiar. The worldly
experience, which this kindly old gentleman
brings from his musty office, is invaluable to his
clients.</p>

<p>The large City firms of solicitors, on the other
hand, occupy spacious suites of offices and maintain
elaborate organizations like modern banks,
with scores of clerks distributed in many departments,
whose duties are so specialized that no one
of them has much grasp of the business as a
whole. The name of such a firm, appearing as
sponsor for an extensive financial project, carries
weight in the business world and its heads
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
enjoy generous incomes, besides being men of
much importance upon whom the honor of
knighthood is sometimes conferred.</p>

<p>In all England and Wales only about 17,000
solicitors took out annual certificates last year.
This indicates the number of offices and does not
include clerks (many of whom have been admitted
to practice as solicitors), nor those who,
for one reason or another, do not practice. Instead
of being concentrated, like the barristers,
in the Inns of Court in London, solicitors are
scattered all over the town and throughout the
Kingdom itself. Some, especially in the minor
towns or poorer quarters of London, are in a
small way of business and must earn rather a
precarious living. Others are of a still lower
class and seek business of a more or less disreputable
character by devious methods, but all are
supposed to have been carefully educated in the
law and are answerable to their Society and to
the courts for questionable practices.</p>

<p>The division of the profession between the
solicitors and the Bar is no doubt a survival in
modern, or socialistic, England of aristocratic
conditions which it is the tendency of the times
to weaken, if not eventually to abolish. It is
somewhat hard upon the solicitor of real ability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to be confined to a limited field and to feel that,
no matter how great his powers and acquirements,
it is impossible to rise to the best position in his
profession without abandoning his branch and
beginning all over again in the barrister's ranks.</p>

<p>In associating with solicitors, one can not fail
to be struck by their attitude towards barristers,
as a class, which is hardly flattering to the latter;
they frequently allude somewhat lightly to them
as though they were useless ornaments and as if
such a division of the profession were rather unnecessary.
Upon asking whether the distinction
exists in America, they receive the information
that it does not with evident approval.</p>

<p>The advantages, however, of the separation of
the functions of the solicitor from those of the
barrister are distinctly felt in the superior skill,
as trial lawyers, developed by the restriction of
court practice to the limited membership of the
Bar, which would hardly exist if the practice
were distributed over the whole field of both
branches of the profession. Then, too, the small
number of persons composing the Bar enables
greater control by the benchers over their professional
conduct, and helps to maintain a high
standard of ethics and the feeling of <i>esprit de
corps</i>. Moreover, the Bar is not distracted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the science, by contact with the business, of the
law and it is saved from the contaminating effect
of participation in the sordid details of litigation.
At the same time, this very condition may be calculated
to develop in the average barrister, as
distinguished from one of real ability, an attitude
approaching dilettanteism.</p>

<p>If the division of the profession ever ceases to
exist, the change will no doubt come about by the
gradual encroachment of the solicitors' branch
upon the Bar. Already solicitors possess the
right of audience in the county courts, the
limit of whose jurisdiction is constantly being
increased, with the result of developing a species
of solicitor-advocate, whose functions are very
similar to those of the barrister. The more
this progresses, the greater will be the number of
solicitors who will become known as court practitioners,
and whose services will be sought by the
public and even by other solicitors, providing an
existing act forbidding the latter is repealed.</p>

<p>While such is the drift in England, there is at
the same time a tendency in America to approach
English conditions in the evolution of the law
firm composed of lawyers of whom some are
known as distinctively trial lawyers, while the
other members devote themselves to the business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the law, and indeed one now occasionally hears
of such partnerships designating one of their
number as "counsel" to the firm&mdash;which is, perhaps,
an affectation.</p>

<p>Solicitors often become barristers&mdash;sometimes
eminent ones, for they have an opportunity
to study other barristers' methods, and have acquired
a knowledge of affairs. Of course they
must first retire as solicitors and enter one of the
Inns for study. The late Lord Chief Justice of
England began his career as an Irish solicitor.</p>

<p>Solicitors wear no distinctive dress (except a
gown when in the county court, as will be explained
hereafter) but attire themselves in the
conventional frock or morning coat and silk hat
which is indispensable for all London business
men. They all, however, carry long and shallow
leather bags, the shape of folded briefs, which are
usually made of polished patent leather.</p>

<h3>BUSINESS AND FEES</h3>

<blockquote><p>INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS OF BARRISTER&mdash;JUNIOR'S
AND LEADER'S BRIEF FEES&mdash;FEES OF
COMMON LAW AND CHANCERY BARRISTERS&mdash;BARRISTER
PARTNERSHIPS NOT ALLOWED&mdash;ENGLISH
LITIGATION LESS IMPORTANT
THAN AMERICAN&mdash;CLERKS OF
BARRISTERS AND SOLICITORS HAGGLE
OVER FEES&mdash;SOLICITORS' FEES.</p></blockquote>


<p>An American lawyer will be curious concerning
two things, about which he will get little reliable
information, viz., how legal business comes
and what are its rewards.</p>

<p>The barrister supplements his reading, sometimes
by practical service for a short time in a
solicitor's office and nearly always by the deviling
before described, and thus, in theory&mdash;and according
to the traditions of the Bar&mdash;may pass
years awaiting recognition. Finally, briefs begin
to arrive which are received by his clerk with
the accompanying fee, in gold, as to which the
barrister is presumed to be quite oblivious. This,
however, is not always the experience of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
modern barrister, who may have some relative
occupying the position of chairman of a railway,
or of a large City company, the solicitors of
which will be apt to think of this particular
man when retaining counsel. In such fashion
and other ways, while he can not receive business
directly from an influential friend or relative, but
only through the medium of a solicitor, yet such
connections are often definitely felt in giving the
young barrister a start. His eventual success,
however, as in every other career, depends upon
how well he avails himself of his opportunities.</p>

<p>When briefed as a junior, without a leader, in
a small action, his fee may be "3 &amp; 1," meaning
three guineas for the trial and one guinea for the
"conference" with the solicitor. When briefed
with a leader, however, his fee, which is always
endorsed on the brief, may read:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<table summary="business and fees">
<tr>
<td><span class="smcap">"Mr. J. Jones . . . .</span></td><td class="tdr">35 guineas</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">1 guinea</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">36 guineas</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>"With you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Sir J. Black, K. C.</span>"</td>
<td class="tdr">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The leader's brief will be endorsed:</p>

<table summary="business and fees 2">
<tr>
<td>"<span class="smcap">Sir J. Black, K. C. . . . .</span></td><td class="tdr">50 guineas</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">2 guineas</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">52 guineas</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>"With you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Mr. J. Jones"</span></td>
<td class="tdr">&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The fee is not always sent by the solicitor with
the brief, but a running account, with settlements
at intervals, is not uncommon. Contingent fees
are absolutely prohibited, the barrister gets his
compensation, or is credited with it, irrespective
of the result.</p>

<p>All speculation as to professional earnings of a
barrister must be vague, for there can be little
accurate knowledge on such a subject. Chancery
men seem to earn much less than common law
barristers and their business is of a quieter and
less conspicuous character. At the fireside in
chambers in Lincoln's Inn, if the conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
drifts to fees, one may hear a discussion as to
how many earn £2,000, and a doubt is expressed
whether more than three men average £5,000,
but the gossips will add that they do not really
know the facts.</p>

<p>The fees of common law men, while larger, are
equally a matter of guess-work. One hears of
the large earnings of Judah P. Benjamin a generation
ago, and R. Barry O'Brien, in his life of
Sir Charles Russell, quotes from his fee book
yearly showing that the year he was called to the
Bar he took only £117, while thirty-five years
later&mdash;in 1894&mdash;just before he was elevated
to the bench, his fees for the year were £22,517.
For the ten years preceding he had averaged
£16,842, and, for the ten years before that, £10,903.
The biographer of Sir Frank Lockwood,
a successful barrister, relates that he earned £120
his first year and that this increased to £2,000
in his eighth year, but he was glad to accept during
his twenty-second year the Solicitor Generalship,
paying about £10,000. The Attorney General,
who, although his office is a political one, is
generally a leading barrister, receives a salary of
£7,000 and his fees are about £6,000 more.</p>

<p>The clerk of a one time high judicial officer
now dead, is authority for the statement that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
year before he went upon the bench his fees aggregated
30,000 guineas. It seems to be the
general opinion of those well informed that the
most distinguished leader may, at the height of
his career, take 20,000 to 25,000 guineas. All
such estimates must, however, be received with
the greatest reserve, and no one could undertake
to vouch for them.</p>

<p>Barristers' fees are, of course, for purely professional
services and do not come within the
same category as the immense sums one occasionally
hears of being received by American
lawyers&mdash;not, however, as a rule, for real professional
services in litigation, but for success in
promoting, merging or reorganizing business
enterprises. The fees of English barristers are
practically all gain, as there are no office expenses
worth mentioning. No suit can be brought by a
barrister to compel the payment of a fee although
the services have been performed, nor
is he liable for negligence or incompetence in his
professional work.</p>

<p>Partnerships, which are common between solicitors,
are unknown to barristers and anything
approaching them would be the subject of severe
discipline. This is a fundamental law of the profession,
never questioned, as to which the rulings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of the governing body of the Bar (some of which
will be quoted in a later chapter) relate only to
the application of the principle to different circumstances.
In order to appreciate the abhorrence
of partnerships, it is necessary to bear in
mind the fact that the great science of the law is to
the barrister strictly a profession, having no affinity
to a business or a trade. No barrister can
have the slightest personal concern in the interests
which he advocates, his fee being never contingent,
nor is he ever permanently retained by
salary or otherwise. He is a purely intellectual
ally of the court in the consideration of questions,
more or less abstract, as to which he merely supports
the view he has undertaken to urge.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, professional rewards do not
strike an American as particularly large, remembering
that the recipients are at the top of the
profession in London, which means the Kingdom.</p>

<p>One can not escape the impression that litigation
in England deals with minor matters as compared
with that of America. There are no American
data for comparison with the admirable
judicial statistics of England, but, in listening to
the daily routine of the London courts, in the
tight little Island with its dense population and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
well-settled rights, there seems to be a complete
absence of those far-reaching litigations which
arise in America, involving enormous sums, or
conflicting questions concerning a whole continent,
with its railroads and rivers extending as
avenues of commerce for thousands of miles and
with ramifications of trade running into many
States, each with its separate sovereignty.</p>

<p>One circumstance rather indicates that the
popular estimate of fees is above the truth, and
this is the acceptance of judgeships by the most
eminent barristers; still, judicial salaries in England
are high&mdash;£5,000 at the least&mdash;not to speak
of the compensation of the Chief Justice and
Lord Chancellor, which are more.</p>

<p>Solicitors' clerks occasionally haggle and bargain
with barristers' clerks in an undignified
manner&mdash;but of this their masters are supposed
to be in ignorance. And it seems that the matter
of fees is sometimes abused. In the case of a celebrated
barrister, now dead, it is whispered that
his clerk would receive a retainer of 500 guineas
on behalf of the K. C. who would be missing upon
the cause being reached. The clerk would then
tell the solicitor's clerk that the K. C. was overcrowded,
and he did not believe he could get him
into court unless 250 guineas were added to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
fee. After grumbling and protesting, the addition
would be forthcoming, whereupon the clerk
would readily find the K. C. strolling in the Temple
Gardens, and fetch him to court. This, however,
was not regarded as honest and the story
itself is doubted.</p>

<p>In the case of solicitors, the acquirement of a
practice is apparently much like establishing a
mercantile business. The majority doubtless
begin as clerks in existing firms, and, if men of
ability, either rise in the firm or form their own
associations. They are not hampered by the same
considerations of delicacy and etiquette as the
barrister, but may seek employment, although, of
course, the one guarantee of real success is the
honest and efficient handling of affairs with which
they may be entrusted.</p>

<p>The profits of a large firm of solicitors are very
great. Much of the money, however, is made in
the transaction of business which is not of the
profession at all, such as the promotion of enterprises,
the flotation of companies, just as there
is a class of American lawyers pursuing the same
lines.</p>

<p>A solicitor's compensation, called "solicitor's
costs," is not a matter of discretion, but is regulated
by a recognized scale, although he may make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a special agreement with his client in advance,
but it must be in writing and is subject to review
by a Master as to its reasonableness. For an appearance
in court the charge runs from 6s. 8d.
to £1. 1s. 0d., according to the nature of the
business and the time consumed. A charge reading,
"To crossing the street to speak to you and
finding it was another man, 1s. 3d.," has been
ruled out.</p>

<p>A solicitor's compensation for services other
than litigation is obtained by rendering to the
client a regular bill, minutely itemized. The writing
of a post card will justify a charge of three
shillings and sixpence, but, for a letter the demand
may be five shillings and sixpence with a half-penny
for the stamp. Each interview at the office, and
every visit to the client's town or country house,
is charged for; while incidental outlays and expenses
are carefully detailed, including the fees
paid the barrister for his opinions, for the drafting
of pleadings and for appearance in court.
If the matter has involved proceedings in court
in which the solicitor's client has been successful,
then various costs are allowed as part of the judgment
to be recovered from the opposite side, although
they do not necessarily equal the charges
to be paid by the client, as will be explained when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
dealing with the subject of costs. Solicitors, unlike
barristers, may sue for their compensation
and are liable for negligence, although not for
mistaken opinions upon questions of law.</p>

<h3>DISCIPLINE OF THE BAR AND OF
SOLICITORS</h3>

<blockquote><p>THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE BAR&mdash;THE
STATUTORY COMMITTEE OF THE INCORPORATED
LAW SOCIETY&mdash;RULINGS ON VARIOUS
MATTERS&mdash;LAPSES FROM CORRECT
STANDARDS.</p></blockquote>


<p>The discipline of the Bar&mdash;the maintenance of
correct standards of professional conduct&mdash;is
everywhere a difficult problem. In England,
with the experience of centuries, good results are
obtained, upon the whole, considering that human
nature is alike the world over. The General
Council of the Bar governs the Bar; the
Statutory Committee of the Incorporated Law
Society governs the solicitors. These two bodies
occasionally confer together&mdash;or rather exchange
views&mdash;in matters concerning the relations of the
two branches of the profession.</p>

<p>The General Council of the Bar, having heard
a complaint against a barrister, reports its findings
with recommendations&mdash;perhaps of disbarment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in exceptionally serious cases&mdash;to the
Benchers of the barrister's Inn. They alone have
the power to act and nearly always follow the
recommendation. Probably little difference exists
in their deliberations, methods and actions in
serious cases and that of corresponding disciplinary
agencies in the United States, whether
called a Bar Committee or a Committee of Censors.
Disbarment is an extreme penalty in both
countries, inflicted only for moral turpitude
amounting usually to crime.</p>

<p>But the General Council of the English Bar
renders an even greater service to the profession
in establishing standards of professional conduct,
not only in respect of morality, but in questions
of propriety and good taste. This is accomplished
by resolutions upon submitted questions
which seem to fall into two classes: those which
are found contrary to a "Rule of the Profession"
and those which are pronounced to be "Undesirable
Practices". These rulings (without
names or other particulars which might lead to
identification) are all reported in the "White
Book", an annual book of practice in general use,
and constitute a code of ethics and etiquette.</p>

<p>An examination of these rulings shows very
few findings upon rudimentary morals; it apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is taken for granted that lawyers are
familiar with such commandments as "Thou
shalt not steal." They deal chiefly with the more
refined questions of professional conduct which
often present difficulties even to men of honest
instincts but who lack natural delicacy or experience.</p>

<p>An example of a course contrary to a rule of
the profession is the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>County Court Judge's Sons</i>: It should be
recognized as a 'Rule of the Profession' (the
quotation marks are the Council's) that no barrister
should habitually practice in any county court
of which his father, or any near relative, is the
judge." An. St. 1895-1896, p. 6.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not necessary to discuss whether this
would be applicable in America. Here the
principle is probably recognized in the larger
cities by the best element, whereas in the country,
with only one county judge, it would prevent a
son's following his father's profession. The ruling
merely illustrates that in England there is an
authoritative body which could be asked to declare
how the profession regards such a difficult
question as, whether suitors should be obliged to
see their cases won or lost by the arguments of a
son addressed to his father, or whether the son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
should be excluded from the only court of his
vicinity.</p>

<p>That a kind of sporting magnanimity is desirable
but not required by any 'rule of the profession',
is shown in the following, which refers
to revenue laws requiring receipts and other
papers to be stamped in order to constitute evidence:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Stamps</i>: It is undesirable that counsel should
object to the admissibility of any document upon
the ground that it is not, or is insufficiently,
stamped, unless such defect goes to the validity
of such document. It is also undesirable that
counsel should take part in any discussion that
may arise in support of any objection taken on
the ground aforesaid unless invited to do so by
the court." An. St. 1901-1902, p. 5.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next point has been the subject of judicial
rulings in America to the same effect:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Damages</i>: <i>Mentioning in Court Amount
claimed</i>: There is a general understanding that
it is irregular for plaintiff's counsel to mention
during the trial the amount claimed by way of
damages." An. St. 1898-1899, p. 11.</p></blockquote>

<p>A series of rulings hold that a barrister occupying
the office of town clerk, or clerk of any similar
public body, "ought not" to practice at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Bar and that it is "undesirable" for such an
official to be called to the Bar. (An. St. 1896-1897,
p. 9, 1898-1899, p. 10, 1899-1900, p. 5.)
Again it has been held that there is a generally
understood "Rule of the Profession" that a barrister
should not practice at Quarter or Petty
Sessions in the county of which he is a magistrate,
but he may practice at the Assizes for his
county. (An. St. 1901-1902, p. 6.)</p>

<p>The following illustrates the aversion to anything
approaching advertising:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Photographs in Legal Newspapers</i>: It is undesirable
for members of the Bar to furnish
signed photographs of themselves for publication
in legal newspapers." An. St. 1900-1901,
p. 8.</p></blockquote>

<p>Likewise the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Names of Counsel giving Opinions: Publication
of</i>: The practice of certain newspapers publishing
the names of counsel in connection with
opinions printed in their columns has been altered
to meet the wishes of the Council." An. St.
1896-1897, p. 9.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a little obscure and furnishes
no information as to what alteration was
effected. The daily papers invariably print the
names of all counsel and solicitors engaged in any
reported litigation and the object of this ruling is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
probably to prevent indirect advertising by writing
opinions upon current topics.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be remarked
that the law reports of the leading papers
are far superior to similar reports in most
American journals. The chief difference
is that, instead of disjointed fragments
throwing the sensational into disproportionate relief
and thus conveying little idea of the whole,
the reports are really accurate and symmetrical,
the drama, however, losing none of its interest.
The perusal of these reports, instead of leaving
a desire to know what really occurred, gives a
feeling of being fully informed. Brevity is served
by admirable condensation of the evidence, arguments
and rulings, and by the use of the third
person in narration. By occasional recourse, too,
to the first personal pronoun, and a verbatim report
of graphic passages, the important and interesting
phases of the case are emphasized.
These reports indicate that the authors are men
trained both in the law and in writing. So well
done are those of the London <i>Times</i> that they
are generally used in court for the citation of
recent decisions, and, when collected and issued
periodically, are universally employed for reference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

The English Courts scrupulously guard
against the trial of cases in the newspapers rather
than in court. In the recent trial of Dr. Crippen
for murder, the proprietor of a provincial newspaper
which, in printing the news of the arrest,
had speculated upon the probability of Crippen's
guilt, was summoned before the court after the
trial had been concluded and was fined £100 on
the ground that the article was calculated to interfere
with the cause of justice. A prominent
London daily newspaper was likewise fined £200
for relating that Crippen had confessed his
guilt, while a London evening paper was fined
a like sum because, during the course of the trial,
it published a statement not contained in the evidence.</p>

<p>Many of the resolutions of the General Council
of the Bar deal with the rights and privileges
of the profession. One is thus reminded that the
Inns of Court, which came into existence with
the ancient London Trades Guilds, were founded
originally for a like purpose&mdash;the protection of
a particular occupation. During the established
vacations many junior barristers take only a few
days' holiday and particularly on the Chancery
side, quite a number of them and also a few
K. C.'s are at work in their chambers or attend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the weekly sittings of the Vacation Court during
the greater part of the Long Vacation.
It appears, however, that some young devil
once attempted to obtain a ruling that another
devil should not devil in vacation, but the
Council declined to sustain his contention as
follows: "<i>Devilling in Vacation</i>: There is no
'Rule of the Profession' against it." An. St.
1900-1909, p. 8.</p>

<p>A few years ago, there was a newspaper
agitation against the Long Vacation which had
always extended from August 12th to the first
Monday of November. The result of the discussion
was to shorten it, by making it begin&mdash;as
it now does&mdash;on August 1st and end on the
12th of October. There are also liberal vacations
at Christmas, Easter and Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>One resolution of the Council illustrates the
fact, already referred to, that barristers are not
nearly so intimately identified with litigation
conducted by them as are American lawyers and
that their cases are more or less like abstract
propositions placed in their hands to be advocated.
The resolution is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Briefs, Obligation to Accept</i>: The general rule
is that a barrister is bound to accept any brief,
in the courts in which he professes to practice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at a proper professional fee. Special circumstances
may justify his refusal to accept a particular
brief. Any complaint as to the propriety
of such refusal, if brought to the attention of the
Council and by them considered reasonable,
would be transmitted by them to the Benchers
of the Inn of which the barrister is a member."
An. St. 1903-1904, p. 15.</p></blockquote>

<p>Conversely; a barrister can not offer inducements
for briefs, as was held in the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Commissions or Presents from Barristers</i>: Any
barrister who gave any commission or present to
any one introducing business to him would be
guilty of most unprofessional conduct which
would, if detected, imperil his position as a barrister."
An. St. 1899-1900, p. 6.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Fees to Barrister's Clerk</i>: The clerk of Mr. A.
informed the clerk of Mr. B. that the latter (Mr.
B.) had received a brief on circuit because he had
recommended the solicitor to Mr. B. (as was the
fact) and suggested that Mr. B. should give him
the clerk's fees which he would have received on
it, had Mr. A. been on circuit and so able to accept
the brief. Mr. B., considering that such a
practice might lead to serious abuses, if it were
countenanced, requested a pronouncement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Council on the matter. The Council expressed
the opinion that the practice referred to is absolutely
improper." An. St. 1904-1905 VII, p. 11.</p></blockquote>

<p>A number of rulings serve to define the limitations
or partial exceptions to the rule that a barrister's
clients are exclusively solicitors and that
he must never be in direct contact with litigants
themselves.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Non-contentious Business</i>: There is no rule
against a barrister advising in non-contentious
business without the intervention of a solicitor,
but it is an undesirable practice. If fees should
be taken for such opinion, such fees must be
marked and paid in the usual way, and on the
ordinary scale, not by way of annual payment
or salary." An. St. 1896-1897, p. 11.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Counsel advising on Case submitted by Colonial
Advocates</i>: A counsel does not commit any
breach of etiquette in advising, without the intervention
of an English solicitor, on a case
submitted to him by a colonial advocate in a colony
where the professions of barrister and solicitor
are combined." An. St. 1902-1903, p. 11.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, it was held that a barrister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"should not" appear as spokesman for a deputation
of contractors waiting upon a public body,
nor on behalf of an application for a license, without
the intervention of a solicitor.</p>

<p>The preservation of the barrister's dignity in
his relations with the solicitor seems to have induced
this:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Conferences at a Solicitor's Office</i>: The Council
have expressed an opinion that as a general rule
it is contrary to etiquette and improper for a
barrister to attend conferences at a solicitor's office,
but that under exceptional circumstances the
rule may be departed from." An. St. 1904-1905,
p. 10.</p></blockquote>

<p>The complicated subject of one barrister assisting
another, usually in the capacity of a devil,
while avoiding quasi-partnerships, has been the
occasion for frequent resolutions by the General
Council of the Bar, of which the following are
a few:</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is not permissible, or in accordance with
professional etiquette, for a counsel to hand over
his brief to another counsel to represent him in
court as if the latter counsel had himself been
briefed; unless the client consents to this course
being taken.... In the Chancery Division
it is not the practice for one junior to hold a brief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
(other than a mere formal one) for another and
the same is true of King's Counsel."</p>

<p>"In the King's Bench Division, in the case
of juniors, it is not uncommon for one counsel to
devil a brief for another: but in the case of King's
Counsel it is very seldom done."</p>

<p>"There is no rule or settled practice governing
the remuneration for devilling, or assistance
given by one counsel to another, in the cases
above referred to."</p>

<p>"With regard to juniors, it is a common practice
in the Chancery Division for the one counsel
to remunerate the other by paying him an agreed
proportion, generally one half, of the fees the
former receives in respect of opinions or drafting.
In the King's Bench Division, remuneration
for devilling of briefs or assistance in drafting
opinions is not common. In both Divisions
occasionally such work is remunerated either by
casual or periodical payments."</p>

<p>"An arrangement of this kind is also not unfrequently
made in the case of a King's Counsel
who desires regular assistance from a junior in
the perusal and noting of his briefs."</p>

<p>"So far as the Council are aware, there is no
practice to pay any remuneration in the rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
cases where one King's Counsel holds a brief for
another."</p>

<p>"In conclusion the Council desires to say that
no practice in the least resembling a partnership
is permissible or (so far as they know) practiced
between Counsel: and they are of opinion
that the etiquette of the profession forbids the
handing over of work by one counsel to another,
outside of the conditions above stated." An. St.
1902-1903, p. 4.</p></blockquote>

<p>A large number of resolutions deal with the
subject of fees and refreshers. Thus, it is held
that while the Council is not a debt-collecting
body, yet, where it is "in the interest of the whole
profession" that solicitors who default in payment
should be "exposed and punished" assistance
may be given by the Council to a barrister
in taking proceedings before the Statutory Committee
of the Law Society&mdash;the solicitor's governing
body. (An. St. 1901-1902, p. 13.) Again
it was resolved that a junior Chancery man was
not precluded by the etiquette of the Bar from
accepting a refresher less in amount than two-thirds
or three-fifths of the refresher accepted
by the leader. (An. St. 1903-1904, p. 14.)</p>

<p>Somewhat in the same line is the following:
"A King's Counsel should refuse all drafting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
work and written opinions on evidence as being
appropriate to juniors only; but a King's Counsel
is at liberty to settle any such drafting and advice
on evidence in consultation with a junior.
A King's Counsel in accordance with a long-standing
'Rule of the Profession' cannot hold a
brief for the plaintiff on the hearing of a civil
cause in the High Court, Court of Appeals or
the House of Lords, without a junior. It is the
usual practice for a King's Counsel to insist on
having a junior when appearing for the defendant
in like cases and when appearing for the
prosecution or the defence on trials of criminal
indictments". An. St. 1901-1902, p. 4.</p>

<p>The following is more general than most of
the resolutions as it states a fundamental rule
rather than its refinements:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Junior and Leader.</i> <i>Proportion of Fees.</i> <i>Refreshers</i>:&mdash;By
long-established and well-settled
custom a junior is entitled to a fee of from three-fifths
to two-thirds of the leader's fee, and, although
there is no rigid rule of professional etiquette
which prevents him from accepting a brief
marked with a fee bearing a less proportion to
his leader's fee, it is in accordance with the practice
of the profession that he should refuse to do
so in the absence of special circumstances affecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the particular case and that he should be
supported by his leader in such action. An. St.
1900-1901, p. 8. (The Council of Incorporated
Law Society dissent from the view expressed in
this resolution). The same rule applies to refresher".
An. St. 1896-1897, p. 11.</p></blockquote>

<p>The necessity for a barrister upon accepting a
brief in a circuit of which he is not a member, to
see that the solicitor retain a junior belonging to
the circuit, which will later be explained, is recognized
in the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Special Fees at Assizes</i>:&mdash;The universal practice
of the circuits since June 1876 (when the
matter was considered by a Joint Committee of
all the Circuits) is that a counsel going special
on to one circuit from another circuit should, if
a King's Counsel, have a special fee of 50 guineas
in addition to the brief fee, and that one member
of the circuit should be employed on the side on
which the counsel comes special." An. St. 1899-1900,
p. 8.</p></blockquote>

<p>A resolution provides for the settlement of
disputes between barristers and solicitors by their
entering into an agreement to leave the questions
to arbitration, the board to be composed of the
chairman of the General Council of the Bar (or
some member of that Council to be named by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
him) and the President of the Incorporated Law
Society (or some member thereof to be selected
by him). An. St. 1897-1898, p. 9.</p>

<p>The following is a curious resolution:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Barrister Recommending another Barrister as
his Leader or Junior</i>: A barrister ought not to
recommend another as his leader or junior. And
such questions as, who is the best man for a witness
action in such a court? Which leader is
<i>persona grata</i> in such a court? Do you get on
all right with X&mdash;as your leader? are improper
questions and should not be answered." An.
St. 1902-1903, p. 3.</p></blockquote>

<p>Illustrative of this ruling was a recent investigation
of the charge that a barrister, about to
leave town, had recommended another barrister
to a solicitor&mdash;the objections being that such an
act would not only violate the etiquette which
forbids any barrister to laud or decry another
barrister to a solicitor, but also that it might
savor of co-operation in the nature of a partnership
which would never be tolerated. The defence
was successful, however, in showing that
they were old Eton schoolmates and the solicitor
knew them equally well.</p>

<p>The above extracts show how broad in scope
and minute in detail are these authoritative rulings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
on every phase of professional life and daily
practice in England. Many of them would be
totally inapplicable to American conditions, and,
beyond affording a glimpse of peculiar customs
and an elaborate etiquette, possess little value
here. They do, however, show that the experience
of the best Bar in the world justifies the existence
of such a body ready to declare the
standards of professional propriety.</p>

<p>It should not be inferred that in England there
is no lapse from such standards. It requires
some diligence to discover individual shortcomings,
but inquiry will develop that even
"ambulance chasing" is not unknown&mdash;although
greatly reprehended and despised. If the
American observer, on watching the trial of an
action, perhaps against an omnibus company for
personal injuries, will cautiously comment upon
the array of solicitors and counsel representing
a plaintiff apparently not possessed of a sixpence,
and express wonder that he is able to afford
it, the information will be forthcoming that
some solicitor's clerk was probably in a neighboring
"pooblic" and, hearing of an accident, had followed
the injured man, perhaps to the hospital,
and got the case for his master, whose remuneration
would depend upon the result. Pressing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
inquiry further as to whether the solicitor advances
the barrister's fees, it will reluctantly be
admitted that some barristers have relations
with solicitors that should not be looked into too
closely&mdash;in other words that their fees are contingent.
But it will also be added that they are
taking great risks of exposure.</p>

<p>Any one who has sat on a Bar Committee, or
on a Committee of Censors, in America must
have been struck by the frequent instances where
practitioners have fallen into error from sheer
ignorance, due to inexperience or to the fact that
they had not been born and bred to the best traditions.
This is especially true in these days
when law schools are grinding out members of
the Bar who have had no real professional preceptors.
As disbarment or suspension is too
severe a penalty, such lapses pass unreproved
and the standards sink, a result much more deplorable
than the failure of individual discipline.
Many a young lawyer would be induced to mend
his ways if privately and fraternally informed
of professional disapproval and some would be
glad to seek the judgment of such a body if it
could be had without exposing names or particulars.</p>

<p>In this way, too, a body of rulings on the professional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
proprieties applicable to American conditions
would be steadily forced upon the attention
of the whole profession, instead of being
locked in the breasts of the more reputable members
to govern merely their own conduct.</p>

<h3>THE CIVIL COURTS</h3>

<blockquote><p>THE GENERAL SYSTEM&mdash;DIFFERENT COURTS&mdash;RULES
OF PRACTICE MADE BY LORD CHANCELLOR&mdash;JURIES,
COMMON AND SPECIAL&mdash;JUDGES
AND HOW APPOINTED&mdash;JUDGES'
PAY&mdash;COSTS&mdash;COURT NOTES&mdash;SOME DIFFERENCE
IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN
METHODS.</p></blockquote>


<p>The general system of the English courts may
be indicated without detailing the exact limitations
of jurisdiction which would be too technical
for present purposes.</p>

<p>Prior to 1873 there were a large number of
courts with various titles, which had grown up
through centuries of custom and legislation. But
they were nearly all abolished by an Act of Parliament,
or rather their functions were merged
into the present far simpler system. In this radical
re-arrangement, however, two courts&mdash;the
highest and the lowest&mdash;survived; the House of
Lords and the County Courts remain as they
were.</p>

<p>Thus came into being the Supreme Court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Judicature, composed of two branches&mdash;the High
Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal.
The High Court is the one of immediate interest
because here are begun all litigations of every
description, excepting the minor matters which
go to the County Courts, or, perhaps, to the
Registrar's Court.</p>

<p>The High Court is separated into three parts
known as the King's Bench Division, devoted
to jury trials which constitute the great
bulk of business, the Chancery Division, where
equity suits are considered, and the Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division which deals, as
its name implies, with the estates of deceased
persons, with divorce, and with marine matters.</p>

<p>Each of these three divisions has a chief; the
Lord Chief Justice of England presides over the
King's Bench Division and the Lord Chancellor
over the Chancery Division, while the head of
the Probate and Admiralty Division, enjoys no
higher title than that of "President." The number
of judges in the different divisions is fixed by
legislation and is determined by the extent of the
business in each. In every court, except appeal
courts, the evidence is heard by a single judge&mdash;of
course in a separate court room&mdash;with the assistance
of a jury in the King's Bench Division,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but, except in divorce cases, usually without any
jury in the other tribunals which are equity courts.</p>

<p>It was the evident intention of Parliament to
fuse equity and common law practice, but experience
has not proved that this is very feasible, so
that the line which separates the two is nearly as
distinct as it ever was. Nevertheless, a certain
amount of progress has been made in this direction&mdash;probably
all that would be wise&mdash;particularly
in the admission of equitable defenses in
common law actions and in the facility with
which, on the other hand, an equity court is enabled
to obtain the verdict of a jury upon disputed
facts without the old and cumbersome
method of remitting the whole case to a common
law court for a trial upon a special issue.</p>

<p>The rules of practice are established and can
be changed by the Lord Chancellor with the approval
of a majority of the judges. It is provided,
however, that such changes must be submitted
to Parliament and that they become void
if either House passes a resolution of veto within
forty days. The consequences of this very
sensible arrangement are that the vast improvements
in practice which have so greatly facilitated
and accelerated English litigation, have
been effected by the courts and the Bar of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
own initiative without the necessity to rely upon
the action of a legislative body largely incapable
of dealing with such technical and important
questions.</p>

<p>This experience should be borne in mind in the
present movement to lessen the law's delays in
America, and the existing power of the courts
should be utilized, or, if necessary, broadened,
rather than permit Congress and the legislatures
to attempt to deal with details which they
can not in the nature of things fully understand.
It will be recalled that the executive head of the
American Government has not scrupled recently
to designate our methods as, in some respects,
"archaic and barbarous," and has directed attention
to the present equity practice of the United
States Courts. In them, testimony upon disputed
facts is still elicited by an examiner&mdash;a
method long since abandoned in progressive
communities. Such an official, temporarily appointed
by the court, possessing but limited
power and often with little experience, merely
presides, while a stenographer notes the oral evidence
subsequently to be reproduced in typewriting
or print. Thereafter, in some instances,
a Master is appointed to consider the testimony
and report his conclusions, while later the court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
itself does the same thing over again. All lawyers
know how weak in effect is evidence when
reduced to cold type, as compared with that
which falls from the lips of living witnesses, and
how faint and inaccurate are the impressions produced
by the former upon the mind of a judge,
no matter how industrious and able he may be.
Hence, in enlightened systems of jurisprudence,
the witnesses are called directly before the tribunal
which is to decide the facts upon their testimony&mdash;exactly
as they would be brought before
a jury.</p>

<p>The power to bring about such a salutary
change inheres in the Supreme Court of the
United States which, by the simple promulgation
of an order to that effect, without any further
legislation, can forever abolish the obsolete system
now in vogue. This was accomplished years
ago in England and has also been brought about
in some American States&mdash;such as Pennsylvania,
Vermont and others&mdash;with the result that equity
proceedings have been much shortened in duration
and lightened in cost, to the infinite relief of
court, counsel and litigants.</p>

<p>In the King's Bench Division&mdash;the only court
holding jury trials except the County Courts&mdash;the
jury of twelve men may be either a "common"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
jury or a "special" jury. Common juries are
composed of men having practically no property
qualification, it being required only that they
shall occupy realty the rental of which is equivalent
to £10 a year. The result is to exclude those
merely who are practically homeless, as such a
rental represents less, perhaps, than the hire of a
single room. The requirements therefore for
service on an ordinary jury would seem to be little
more than that the juror should have a known
place of residence. His compensation for services
is but one shilling a day.</p>

<p>Special juries, on the other hand, which may
be claimed as a right by either party and whose
services are paid for by the litigants rather than
by the Government, receive one guinea a day and
the members must occupy premises renting for
not less than £50 a year, or a farm worth £300
yearly, or they may be bankers, merchants, or
persons upon whom minor titles have been bestowed.
The employment of special juries is
increasing in frequency at the expense of ordinary
juries and it seems that the facility to obtain
them is also cutting down the number of trials
which the law permits to be conducted by the
judges without any jury at all, provided the parties
so agree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

The Chancery Division, as stated, is the tribunal
for equity trials where juries are rarely
employed, but the judge determines both the law
and the facts. Into this court therefore comes
all the equity litigation of England, although,
for very limited sums, there is a concurrent jurisdiction
in the County Courts. The separation
which exists between practice in this court, and
the barristers who practice therein, as compared
with the common law courts, has already been
described at length. The judges in the equity
courts never wear gowns containing any colors
except black.</p>

<p>The Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division
of the High Court of Justice is, like the Chancery
Division, a court of equity, as distinguished from
a court of law, in which the trials are conducted
by a judge without a jury. Here are considered
all matters concerning decedent's estates, but the
Chancery Division has to do with the construction
of wills and the distribution of property.
Divorces occupy much time of this Court and
furnish sensational material for English newspapers.
They form an exception to the general
rule in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty
division in the presence of a jury and in the submission
of the facts to them.</p>

<p>The Admiralty Court is of course confined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
maritime matters and the room is adorned by a
gilt anchor fixed upon a shield hung upon the
wall behind the presiding judge, who is assisted
in the technical matters by two Trinity Masters&mdash;retired
sea captains.</p>

<p>The County Courts number about 500, not
confined to London but dotted all over England,
the districts of which are much smaller than counties,
notwithstanding they are called County
Courts. One judge suffices for a number of these
courts which are grouped into circuits. In most
courts the judge is allowed to decide both facts
and law, but a jury of eight men can be had at
the instance of either party. The jurisdiction is
at present limited, in common law cases, to £100
and, in equity actions, to £500; while there is no
jurisdiction whatever in the matters of divorce,
libel or slander. In these courts, as will be explained
later, barristers rarely appear but solicitors
are allowed to act as advocates. The County
Courts were established in 1846 and, as mentioned,
were not disturbed in the reorganization
of the courts in 1873, the idea being to bring the
administration of justice closer to the people's
homes and to reduce its cost. The County Courts
no doubt serve to relieve the High Court of a
great mass of petty litigation, and in that respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
are extremely useful, if rather uninteresting.
An appeal lies from the County Court to the
High Court on points of law but it is not often
exercised. For very small matters&mdash;chiefly the collection
of trifling debts&mdash;the Registrar's Court,
which is likewise not confined to London, performs
useful functions which will hereafter be
described more particularly.</p>

<p>Besides the courts above mentioned, the Lord
Mayor's Court in the City of London and the
Palatine Court and Court of Passage, in the
north of England, are local courts which transact
a great deal of business.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, is the English arrangement of
courts for the disposal of civil as distinguished
from criminal business.</p>

<p>The judges of all courts are appointed&mdash;not
elected&mdash;and their terms of office are for life with
provisions for retirement and pension. Judicial
salaries are much higher in England than in
America. Ordinary judges of the High Court
get £5,000, the Lords of Appeal, £6,000, the
Chief Justice, £8,000, and the Lord Chancellor,
£10,000. The appointing power&mdash;nominally
the crown&mdash;is really the Lord Chancellor, who,
unlike the Lord Chief Justice and all the other
judges of England, is a political incumbent
changing with the Government. It might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
supposed from this fact that the Lord Chancellor
would yield to a natural temptation in making
judicial appointments and that his selections
would constitute a distribution of political patronage.
There appears to be nothing in the law
to prevent this, and formerly judges were largely
appointed for political considerations or by reason
of personal or social influences.</p>

<p>At present, however, the least observation will
convince any one that the great majority of judicial
appointments in England are made solely
out of consideration for character and professional
attainments. With few exceptions the
judges appointed in modern times&mdash;no matter
what party may have been in power&mdash;have been
selected from amongst the leading barristers
of the day, and a person who has been
in the habit for years of frequenting the courts
at intervals, is almost sure, when he misses an
eminent barrister from the front row, to find him
on the bench, if alive. While this is the general
rule, it is true that in rare and exceptional cases
one hears of the appointment of a judge who is
regarded by the profession as not being well qualified
and his selection is attributed to influence.
The just admiration which Americans entertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
for the English judiciary as a body will in such
instances not be reflected by the views of the
English Bar, with opportunities for observation
at closer range. Barristers will remark that a
given judge is not a lawyer at all, but merely had
the gift of gaining cases before juries, and that
the political influence he acquired induced the
government to give him an office for which he is
ill equipped. And one may even hear the statement
made concerning some judge, "I can not
say he is venal; I can not say he can be bought
for money; but he has naturally a dishonest mind
and can not perceive the truth."</p>

<p>A stranger is left to speculate how far such
views may reflect some past grudge and he will
probably come to the conclusion that the high
standing of the English judiciary, in the opinion
of all the world, is fully deserved, but that
there are some few exceptions to this general
excellence.</p>

<p>Costs play an important part in all English
litigation. The tendency since the time of the
Stuarts has been constantly to increase them.
By costs&mdash;as understood in England&mdash;is not
meant the official fees payable to the court officers,
but a sum which the unsuccessful party is
condemned to pay to the successful party, the aim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
being to indemnify the side whom the event proves
to have been in the right. If a litigant has incurred
expense to obtain a judgment for a sum
of money, then he must be reimbursed by the
other side who occasioned his outlay by refusal to
pay. On the other hand, if an unjust claim has
been made against him, the claimant must repay
his expenses in resisting it.</p>

<p>Part of these costs are taxed as the case proceeds.
Thus, if one party summon another before
a Master prior to trial, to obtain an order
for the production of some document, the Master
imposes costs&mdash;say £2. 10s. 0d.&mdash;upon the party
who refused to produce, or upon the party who,
the Master finds, has unwarrantably demanded
the production. The theory here is to discourage
unnecessary and harassing interlocutory proceedings.</p>

<p>But the principal costs "await the event"&mdash;follow
the course of the final judgment. They
include an allowance for counsel fees, which,
however, is not always as much as the amount
paid by the litigants. For, if a litigant has indulged
in the luxury of an unusual array of counsel,
he must do so at his own expense, and the
Master allows only what he should have laid out
in fees. Thus, in a petty action, caused by some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
personal pique, the plaintiff may have insisted
that his solicitor retain a K. C. at fifty guineas
and a junior at thirty-five guineas, involving a
total expense, with three guineas for the consultation,
of eighty-eight guineas. The defendant,
however, has been content with a junior at "3 &amp;
1." If the plaintiff succeeds, the Master will not
allow him the eighty-eight guineas, but will decide
that the more modest armament of the defendant
would have been sufficient.</p>

<p>Costs are, upon the whole, very high. In an
ordinary action to recover a moderate sum&mdash;say
£200&mdash;the costs will generally amount to £50.
In a recent action to recover £60, the balance of
the purchase price of a motor car, costs were
claimed of over £400, and actually allowed in a
sum over £200. Though this was exceptional,
owing to the unreasonable stubbornness with
which a just claim was resisted, and is by no
means typical, yet it illustrates the possibilities
of the system.</p>

<p>In theory it seems reasonable that the party
in the wrong should reimburse the party in the
right for having vexatiously put him to expense
in obtaining his due. In practice, however, the
prospect of large costs may stimulate unjust
suits by impecunious plaintiffs&mdash;unable themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to respond in costs if defeated&mdash;against
richer defendants vulnerable for whatever the
chances of war may have in store for them. To
this criticism English lawyers can only answer
that if the plaintiff is unable to give security for
costs, he may, in actions of tort, at least, be remitted
to the County Courts, where the costs
are much lighter. This, however, is merely a
mitigation of the evil.</p>

<p>The general opinion seems to be that high costs
discourage litigation. This may be true, but if
they tend as well to obstruct the assertion of just
rights and to stimulate fictitious claims, they are
not to be desired by the profession or by the laity.</p>

<p>A jury trial strikes one as more cut and dried
in an English than in an American court. Apparently,
through the exchange of documents
and otherwise, so much is known to the opposing
counsel, solicitors and judge, that the element of
surprise is largely eliminated. If all the litigants
were honest, and the law were an exact science,
this might conduce to a deliberate consideration
of the questions involved. But what American
advocate, having confronted a disingenuous witness
with his own letter, utterly at variance with
his testimony, could say that the cause of justice
would have been better served if the witness had
known that the letter was to be produced and had
had the chance to regulate his evidence accordingly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>And what American lawyer would not
feel that half the fun of life were gone?</p>

<p>During the examination of witnesses, notwithstanding
the rapidity of articulation, an American
ear is struck by a certain lack of snap and by
the great deliberation and long intervals between
questions, which afford&mdash;especially for a dishonest
witness under cross-examination&mdash;too much
time for reflection. This impression may be due
to differences in national temperament, and the
examination may seem even rapid to an English
listener. Perhaps the chief cause of the hesitancy
is the fact that the examiner has obtained
his information at second hand, from his client
the solicitor, or his junior or devil, and has to feel
his way. A kind of confidence in the veracity of
witnesses appears to pervade the court; and they
are, indeed, as a rule, uncommonly frank.</p>

<p>English barristers do not know their cases as
well as American lawyers. They have not conducted
the preliminaries, nor become acquainted
with and advised the parties they are to represent;
in other words, they have not "grown up
with the case," and the facts are more like abstract
propositions lately placed in their hands to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
be presented. It is not unusual during the trial,
when some unexpected situation arises, to see evidence
of a lack of familiarity with the circumstances
which requires instant reference to the
solicitor.</p>

<p>The judges take a larger part in trials than
in most American courts&mdash;a practice which has
much to commend it, and which is increasing on
this side of the water. An American lawyer will
say, "I tried a case before Judge So-and-so"&mdash;an
English barrister says: "I conducted a case
which Lord So-and-so tried." The English
judge restrains counsel, often examines the witnesses,
and his influence is quite openly exerted to
guide the jury and cause them to avoid absurdities
and extremes. Yet, the crucial questions of
fact really to be determined&mdash;of which there are
usually but one or two&mdash;are left absolutely to the
jury's unfettered decision.</p>

<p>Objections to questions by opposing counsel,
which cut so large a figure in an American trial,
are rarely made. One is told that the barristers
know the rules of evidence too well to ask improper
questions and that they have too much
respect for the court to hazard a rebuke. This is
a very pretty, but hardly a satisfactory, explanation.
Observation of many trials gives the impression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rather, that great laxity prevails as to
what is a proper question and that the party
aggrieved by an objectionable one prefers to rely
upon the reaction in his favor in the judge's mind,
which will be shown when his influence comes to
be exercised upon the jury.</p>

<p>That this laxity prevails, the least experience
will show. Upon direct examination leading
questions, which in America would bring a storm
of objection, pass unnoticed, and even hearsay
evidence is not unknown. The absence of the
element of surprise in trials, may make those concerned
more tolerant of counsel leading in a story
known to all beforehand. The occasional element
of hearsay is more difficult to explain unless,
indeed, the French view gains in England, which
justifies the admission of hearsay on the ground
that in the most important questions of life&mdash;for
example, in respect to the reputation of a man
whom one contemplates trusting, or of a woman
one thinks of marrying&mdash;men act exclusively
upon hearsay and never upon direct evidence.
But, of course, the law of evidence remains in
England as it always has been: all that is here
meant is that a degree of tolerance prevails and
upon careful observation, the real cause of this
tolerance will be found in the fact that both sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
rely on the influence of the judge to eliminate
from the minds of the jury the effect of evidence
wrongly introduced.</p>

<p>In England, mistress of the seas, with much
the greatest merchant marine in the world, and
with a large insular population living in close
touch with the water, one finds, as might be expected,
the best Admiralty Courts and Bar in
the world.</p>

<p>The chart used by counsel in examining witnesses
is pinned to a sloping table, among the
barrister's benches and facing the Court. In
collision cases, small models of steamers and sailing
vessels, as well as arrows to indicate winds and
tides, are employed. All of these may be veered
and shifted as the trial progresses, by means of
thumb pins projecting beneath and capable of
being pressed into the table which has a cork top.
The Admiralty trials are beautifully conducted
and great familiarity with the affairs of the sea is
displayed by the participants.</p>

<p>Models are very much used in all English
Courts. In land condemnation, nuisance injunction
and accident cases, one frequently sees
elaborate models reproducing the <i>locus in quo</i>.
In actions concerning floods or other occurrences
affecting considerable areas, models many square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
feet in size, reproducing the whole locality, are
employed.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice sits at nisi prius more often
than upon appeal. It seems odd, during the
trial of an action for damage caused by a flood
due to the alleged improper construction of a
bridge, to see the Lord Chief Justice of England
reaching far down with a long white, lath-like
stick, into the solicitors' well to point out some
feature of a model while interrogating a witness,
and afterwards charging the jury stick in hand.
It is still more strange to hear a judge, whose
name is known the world over, gravely charging
a jury as to the value, as evidence of identity, of
a wart under the tail of a costermonger's donkey,
the ownership of which is in dispute. Yet, like
every feature of an English court, it is eminently
practical and free from form or affectation.</p>

<p>The highly paid judges of the High Court, sit
in the smallest case; the idea seems to be that if
a man desires to assert his rights, however insignificant,
it is the duty of the Government to afford
him the opportunity. In the Divisional Court
(an appeal court of limited jurisdiction) the
Lord Chief Justice of England and two famous
colleagues did not grudge, upon a recent occasion,
to hear an appeal involving nominally £22. 11s.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
6d., payment on account having reduced the
actual amount in controversy to £2. 11s. 6d. As
the salaries of the occupants of the Bench
were not less than £20,000 a year&mdash;to say
nothing of those of the court attendants, and the
fees of the barristers and solicitors on both sides&mdash;the
economy of such an employment of human
effort is not apparent. Some one, however,
thought his rights had been invaded, which justified
the waste, while the costs furnished a small
stake upon the result.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>COURTS OF APPEAL</h3>

<blockquote><p>THE COURT OF APPEAL&mdash;HOUSE OF LORDS&mdash;DIVISIONAL
COURT&mdash;JUDICIAL COMMITTEE
OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Court of Appeal&mdash;the last resort except
for occasional cases which reach the House of
Lords and Colonial appeals which go to the Privy
Council&mdash;is, perhaps, the most perfectly working
tribunal for the adjustment of conflicting rights
which the wit of man in any age has devised. It
is divided into two parts of three judges each,
sitting simultaneously. The Lord Chancellor, the
Chief Justice, or the Master of the Rolls presides
over the respective parts and two associate Lord
Justices of Appeal compose the court.</p>

<p>Printed briefs are not used, though the advantage
of this omission is not apparent. There
is no bill of exceptions and the appeal is in name,
as well as in fact, a motion for a judgment the reverse
of that rendered below or, in the alternative,
for a new trial, and everything which transpired
is open to review. Three barristers&mdash;the leader,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
junior and devil&mdash;together with the solicitors,
are usually found on either side.</p>

<p>The leader for the appellant opens, stating the
case with great particularity, and reads from the
evidence, documents and charge to the jury at
great length. Much time is thus spent because,
for no discoverable reason, but probably due to
ancient custom and lack of enterprise, the
material is all in manuscript, often illegible and
with occasional errors in the copies of the Court
and opposing counsel. The result is tedious and
prosy and an American auditor gets an unfavorable
impression at this stage of the argument; an
impression, however, which is later dispelled.</p>

<p>During the irksome opening, the court has
been getting a grasp of the case, as becomes apparent
when the argumentative stage is reached,
for then there ensues a good tempered, courteous,
informal debate between the several gentlemen,
comprising the court and counsel. There is no
"orating" and no declamation. The positions of
the opponents are stated rapidly and smoothly.
Each, as enunciated, is taken up by one or more
members of the court and distinct intimation
given whether the court agrees with the speaker.
In case it does, he may pass on. On the other
hand, deferential dissent may warn him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
strengthen his position, or a frank expression of
doubt may be accompanied by a friendly invitation
to the other side to contribute suggestions.</p>

<p>At the conclusion, judgment is rendered orally,
in nine cases out of ten, by the presiding Lord
Justice, as the last speaker resumes his seat.
Then follow the opinions of the associate Lord
Justices of Appeal, concurring or dissenting, all
expressed with the utmost frankness and spontaneity.
These are taken down stenographically,
and, after revision, sometimes by the judge
himself, find their way into the books to become
authorities. Occasionally a "considered judgment"
is reserved to be delivered within two or
three days.</p>

<p>The contrast presented by these methods (for
the system is not essentially different) to the
average American appeal is very great. In
America, only the ablest men know by a kind of
intuition upon what points their cases will turn,
and one often hears a more or less stereotyped
speech delivered to a court sitting like silent
images, without the slightest intimation to the
speaker whether he is wasting effort upon conceded
points, or slighting those upon which he
may discover by the written opinion&mdash;delivered
months afterwards&mdash;he has won or lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Sometimes these friendly debates in an English
court of appeal are witty, and they are often
rather amusing. In a case recently argued, the
defendant, a real estate owner, appealed from a
judgment for £300. against him for wrongfully
evicting his tenant, the plaintiff, and putting his
sick wife and furniture out on the sidewalk in
the rain. There was not much to be said in his
favor upon the merits of his act, but his counsel
argued that plaintiff's advocate had used inflammatory
language in his speech to the jury.</p>

<p>The judgment was immediately affirmed, the
Lord Chancellor delivering an opinion to the effect
that the control of the language used was a
matter of discretion for the court below and could
not be examined by the appellate court. Both
of the associate Lord Justices concurred, but one
proceeded to give quite different reasons. With
the preliminary words: "Speaking only for myself,
but not for his Lordship," and with a slight
inclination of his head towards the Lord Chancellor,
he said he was for affirming for an entirely
different reason&mdash;not because he could not examine
the language used below, but rather that
he had done so. He then proceeded to rehearse
the brutal conduct of the defendant, and wound
up by declaring, "If it had been my sick wife and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
my furniture which had been set out in the rain
under the circumstances described, I do not think
the English vocabulary contains the language I
should wish my counsel to use in addressing the
jury." This was received, as is not uncommon
in England, but unheard of in America, with frequent
laughter and even subdued applause, and
the "London <i>Times</i>" in its regular legal column
the next day, reported the opinions and indicated
the "laughter" and "loud laughter" in brackets.
The opinions in the books, after being toned
down by the reporter, often bear but faint resemblance
to the actual utterances.</p>

<p>In the House of Lords appeals are equally informal
and colloquial, an impression that is
heightened by the absence of wigs and gowns, so
far as the bench is concerned, and by the very
casual manner in which the half dozen gentlemen
composing the court are seated. The house
itself is a large, oblong chamber with steep tiers
of seats, upholstered in red leather, which rise
high up the side walls and upon which the peers
sit when legislating, but which are, of course,
empty when the court only sit. At the far end is
an unoccupied throne, while, at the near end,
raised above the floor, is a kind of box from which
counsel address the court. It is much like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
rear platform of one of our street cars. Counsel,
of course, are in wig and gown, and if K. C.'s, in
full bottomed wigs, but one may occasionally see
a litigant actually arguing his own case <i>in propria
persona</i>. On either side of the counsel's
box is a very narrow standing place for reporters
and the public.</p>

<p>The court, consisting of the Lord Chancellor
in gown and full bottomed wig, and perhaps of
five judges, in ordinary clothing, sit at the floor
level, and therefore considerably lower than counsel
in the elevated box. They are not placed in a
row nor behind any bench or table. On the contrary,
though the presiding Lord Chancellor is
vis-a-vis to the counsel box, the others sit where
they please. Sometimes this is on the front row
of benches and sometimes on one of the higher
tiers, with a foot propped up, perhaps, on the
bench in front, and their thumbs hitched to the
armholes of their waist-coats, and, necessarily,
with their sides to the speaker. The members of
the court often have portable tables in front of
them, piled with books and papers. During the
course of an argument they constantly debate
with each other across the House, or walk over to
one of their colleagues with some document or
a book and talk of the case audibly and perfectly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
freely. One may hear one of them, in a salt and
pepper suit, call across the floor to another Lord
of Appeal who has interrupted a barrister's argument,
"I say, can't you give the man a chance to
say what he's got to say?"</p>

<p>These little circumstances show that judges
and counsel in the appellate courts of England
behave as natural men without the slightest restraint,
formality or self-consciousness. Arguments
are delivered with surprising rapidity of
utterance, in a conversational tone, and with a
crispness of articulation altogether delightful to
the ear. The drawling style of speech sometimes
heard on the stage as typical of a certain
kind of Englishman, seems to have disappeared
in real life; it certainly is not to be found in the
Courts. An American stenographer reporting
an English argument, would have to increase his
accustomed speed at least one-third.</p>

<p>The methods of the Divisional Court are the
same as those of the Court of Appeal, but the low
limit of its jurisdiction renders it of little interest.</p>

<p>The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council&mdash;or,
as it is colloquially described by the lawyers,
"The Privy Council"&mdash;is doubtless the most interesting
court in England because of the variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the questions there considered and owing
to the fact that, geographically, the litigations
originate in nearly every quarter of the civilized
world, for, as noted above, this is the court of
last resort for all of the British Colonies. It
should not be confused with the Privy Council
itself&mdash;a political adviser of the Crown&mdash;for the
Judicial Committee's functions are purely judicial
and its personnel consists of the Lord Chancellor
and the other Law Lords, a few paid members,
and some Ex-Colonial Judges. Historically,
indeed, it was but a sub-committee of the
Privy Council, which circumstance gives the
Court its name and explains why its judgments
always conclude with the phrase that the Committee
"humbly advises His Majesty" to affirm
or reverse the judgment rendered in the Colony,
instead of pronouncing the conclusion in direct
language, as do other courts.</p>

<p>This extraordinary body sits in a large second
story chamber, not in the least resembling a
court room, of a building in Downing Street,
and rarely is there any audience other than the
professional men whose business takes them
there.</p>

<p>Of course, most of the Colonies are equipped
with their own court of appeals&mdash;usually called
the Supreme Court&mdash;but, nevertheless, an appeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
lies from their decisions to the Privy Council
in certain circumstances, although to define exactly
the scope of this jurisdiction would be too
technical for present purposes.</p>

<p>Here are to be found, arguing their cases,
lawyers from Colonies in every corner of the
globe in some of which the division of the profession
into barristers and solicitors hardly exists,
or at least, the line separating them is quite
hazy&mdash;but they must all appear in wig and gown.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the fact that the Colonies
of Great Britain are scattered over the whole
world and that it has always been the policy, so
far as possible, to accept the existing law of
each and graft it upon the English law system,
the diversity and broadness of this court's deliberations
may be imagined.</p>

<p>The succession to an Indian Principality, to
be determined under the ancient law of that
far Eastern land, will be followed by a question
of the legality of the adoption of a child in South
Africa, to be considered under the rules of Dutch
law. The next case will, perhaps, involve the
effect upon an area much greater than that of all
England, of the diversion of a river in the Canadian
North-West. And the court may next turn
its attention to the problem whether the widow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a Scotchman who left two wills&mdash;one intended
to operate at home and the other to take effect
in Australia&mdash;can take her thirds against the
will in Scotland but accept the benefits of the
other will as to property in Australia.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeal and the House of Lords
deal with domestic matters of the little Island,
which, however important the principles involved
and however critical the issues to the litigants
themselves, seem almost petty in comparison
with the broad field of the Privy Council. Little
as the average man knows of it, and rarely as it
figures in news of the day, no American lawyer
can fail to perceive in this great court something
of the tremendous scope of his own Supreme
Court of the United States, to which tribunal
only is the Privy Council secondary.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>MASTERS: THE TIME SAVERS</h3>

<blockquote><p>CURRENT HEARINGS&mdash;MINOR ISSUES
THRESHED OUT.</p></blockquote>


<p>The numerous motions and interlocutory applications,
supported by affidavits and urged by
argument, which consume so much of the time
of an American court, are disposed of in England
by Masters&mdash;competent barristers appointed
by the Courts, who are paid salaries of
about £3,000 a year.</p>

<p>At a certain hour the Master takes his seat
at a desk with a printed list of "applications
without counsel" or "applications with counsel."
He nods to the uniformed officer at the door who
admits the solicitors engaged in the cause which
happens to be first on the list of cases "without
counsel." The solicitors stand before the Master
with a shelf upon which to rest books or papers;
one side then states its demand and the other its
objection in the briefest and most direct manner.
The Master's immediate oral decision, accompanied
by imposition of the costs and a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
scratches of his pen on the back of the summons,
indicates to the officer the opening of the door
to admit the next case. By actual count twenty-seven
cases may thus be disposed of in one hour
and thirty-two minutes&mdash;an average of a little
more than three minutes each. Of course there
is a right of appeal, which, however, is rarely
exercised.</p>

<p>As the door opens two solicitors hurry in.
There are no salutations nor introductory remarks
and the business proceeds abruptly:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Plaintiff's solicitor</i>: "Master, we claim £50
judgment for rent."</p>

<p><i>Master to defendant's solicitor</i>: "Do you admit
the amount?"</p>

<p><i>Defendant's solicitor</i>: "Yes, but we claim a set-off."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: (endorsing a few words on the summons)
"Judgment for rent £50 with stay of
execution until counter claim is tried."</p>

<p><i>Defendant's solicitor</i>: "If you please, Master."</p></blockquote>

<p>This expression is the universal vernacular
with which the defeated party accepts the judgment
of a master or judge in all courts. The
expression is not an interrogation but is equivalent
to "as you please."</p>

<p>Out they go and the next enter; here the defendant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
asks for delay, and gets seven days which
is endorsed on the summons and requires a minute.</p>

<p>Then comes an application under "order
XIV" for judgment for £1,000. Defendant
requires four days' delay.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Master</i>: "What is the defence?"</p>

<p><i>Defendant's solicitor</i>: "Master, I don't know&mdash;a
recent agreement has been made between
the parties which I have not yet seen."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "I'll give you four days, but you must
pay the costs of the adjournment; thirteen
shillings and fourpence."</p>

<p><i>Defendant's solicitor</i>: "If you please, Master."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next summons for judgment. As this is
denied, the parties agree to try it before the Master
on the following Thursday without a jury.</p>

<p>Then follows a summons by defendant upon
plaintiff for particulars of goods sold and delivered.
Both parties are dealers in Japanese
bulbs, and the sale was made subject to arrival
in England safe and sound. The defendant demands
particulars of the plaintiff as to who were
his customers. The plaintiff objects to disclosing
his business and the written summons, containing
the request for particulars, is gone over
rapidly by the Master. Such parts of the request
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
as, in his opinion, ought not to have been demanded,
because they pry into the plaintiff's
private affairs, are eliminated by a stroke of the
Master's pen and an order is made at the bottom
in an abbreviated form, imposing the costs of the
summons upon the plaintiff. This means that
the plaintiff is obliged to furnish the defendant,
in so many days, all the particulars which the
Master did not strike out, and must pay the defendant
the costs of the application.</p>

<p>A moment is consumed in giving judgment
in an uncontested case for £1,800 with costs of
£8. 16s. 0d.</p>

<p>Then comes a breach of promise case. The
defendant asks for an order upon the plaintiff
for a statement of claim and discovery of correspondence,
which is granted. As most of the
witnesses are in London, the defendant wants to
try the case here, but the plaintiff wishes to try it
in Manchester where the parties live. The Master
thinks it is easier to bring two people up from
Manchester than to take a dozen down from
London.</p>

<p>Next is a summons for directions:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Master</i>: "Statement of claim in ten days."</p>

<p><i>Plaintiff's solicitor</i>: "Yes, Master."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "Defence in ten days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<i>Defendant's solicitor</i>: "Yes, Master."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "No counter claim?"</p>

<p><i>Defendant's solicitor</i>: "No, Master."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "Documents?"</p>

<p><i>Both solicitors</i>: "Large number."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "All parties in London?"</p>

<p><i>Both solicitors</i>: "Yes."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "Any question of law?"</p>

<p><i>Both solicitors</i>: "No."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "Next case."</p></blockquote>

<p>And he at once endorses a few words on the bottom
of the summons.</p>

<p>Then a defendant appears in person:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Master</i>: "Do you owe the £26?"</p>

<p><i>Defendant</i>: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p><i>Plaintiff's solicitor</i>: "We only want judgment
for £21 because this morning he paid £5
on account, and he agrees to pay £3 a week,
so that we will not issue execution if he does
this."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "I'll give you judgment generally for
£21, but you write defendant a letter stating
that you will not issue execution as you
have just stated."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another defendant appears in person:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Defendant</i>: "I've got no defence, all I want is
time."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<i>Plaintiff's solicitor</i>: "We'll do nothing until
Monday as we think he means to pay."</p>

<p><i>Master</i>: "All right, it is understood you will do
nothing until Monday."</p></blockquote>

<p>The details of practice before these Masters
would be beyond the scope of the present writing,
suffice it to say that rules have been promulgated
from time to time, and are constantly being improved
upon, having for their object the simplification
of procedure, the rapid despatch of business
and the settling of all minor questions which
may arise in a case before actual trial. Thus,
"Order XIV," just referred to, enables a
Master to enter judgment when the defence
averred, even if true, would not be effectual, or
when the defence is obviously frivolous, although,
of course, the rights of the defendant are preserved
by the privilege of appeal, the judgment,
meantime, binding his property. Again, the
"summons for directions" is to enable the Master
to give general directions as to how the parties
shall proceed, the intervals of time to be allowed
for exchange of copies of documents, taking foreign
testimony and what not.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest contrivances in the practice
before Masters is the "tender of damages
in tort without admitting liability." A defendant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
may tender, say, £500. If plaintiff does not
accept it, the trial ensues&mdash;the jury, of course,
being in ignorance of the tender. If the judgment
be for defendant, or for more than the
tender, that is the end of the matter. But if the
judgment be for less than the tender, a large deduction
for costs is made from the judgment,
and inures to the defendant's benefit. This has
enormously reduced the volume of accident cases
and has also curbed the often wildly extravagant
demands and unjust results in such actions generally
recognized as evils difficult to deal with.</p>

<p>In short, the system of Masters in England
works admirably. It is entirely adaptable to
American courts, the details and modifications
which might prove necessary being fitted to local
conditions, but in any such adaptation, the general
purpose should be kept in view, namely, that
when a case appears upon a trial list it shall have
already been pruned of all non-essential preliminary
details and is forthwith to be actually
tried upon its merits; the court's time being too
precious to be expended upon the subsidiary side
issues.</p>

<h3>THE POLICE COURTS</h3>

<blockquote><p>CURRENT HEARINGS.</p></blockquote>


<p>Upon arrest, a preliminary hearing is first
held at a police station where, as in most English
proceedings, the testimony, with anything
the prisoner may say (after he has been warned
of the consequence of self-incrimination) is carefully
reduced to longhand writing and plays
an important part at the subsequent stages of the
prosecution.</p>

<p>The next step is the hearing before a Police
Magistrate at Bow or Marlborough Streets, or
at any one of the like courts in London which,
although of minor importance, are dignified tribunals.
The court room is entered by two small
doors, one for the witnesses and audience, the
other for officials and solicitors, and there is another
passage leading from the cells through
which the prisoners are brought to a dock. This
dock, as in all criminal courts, is at the far end
of the room from the magistrate. The prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
is thus isolated and can only communicate with
his solicitor, if he has been able to retain one, by
scrawling a note and passing it on to an officer.</p>

<p>The magistrate, appointed by the Crown or
the Lord Chancellor acting in its behalf, is almost
invariably a man of standing and repute,
always a barrister, whose ready dispatch of business
shows great experience with crime, and
whose kindness to the merely unfortunate testifies
to his charitableness of heart. He wears no
wig nor gown and is called in court, "Your Worship";
whereas judges of the High Court are
called in court, "My Lord," and those of the
County Courts, "Your Honor." All judges,
however, are addressed in private life as "Mr."
or, if they have one, by a title. A Judge of the
High Court is always knighted on appointment
and in private life is addressed as "Mr. Justice &mdash;&mdash;"
unless he is a Peer. Solicitors act for
the more important prisoners but barristers are
rarely seen and appear in ordinary street dress
if at all.</p>

<p>The early morning run of business consists
chiefly of the "drunks", divided nearly equally
as to sex, and of persons arrested for begging
and minor misbehavior. These cases are disposed
of with great rapidity.</p>

<p>A woman, looking very silly, and with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
millinery somewhat awry, is ushered into the
dock charged with being "drunk and disorderly."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Magistrate</i>: "Do you admit it?"</p>

<p><i>Woman</i>: "Hi hadmit hi 'ad a little too much,
but deny being disorderly, Your Worship."</p>

<p><i>Police Constable</i>: (sworn) "She was banging on
the door of the Black Horse at 2 A.M.
screamin' for drink. I cautioned her and
then saw her repeat this at another closed
'pooblic', so I took her in charge."</p>

<p><i>Magistrate</i>: (To an officer with a book of records)
"Is she known?"</p>

<p><i>Officer</i>: "No, Your Worship, she was never here
before."</p>

<p><i>Magistrate</i>: "Five shillings or five days."</p></blockquote>

<p>As she is rapidly conducted through the passage
and disappears in the direction of the cells,
one hears called from official to official the words:
"Five or five."</p>

<p>The next is an intelligent, elderly, but very
shabby, man charged with begging. The police
officer had testified that a lady gave the prisoner
money and that he immediately entered the nearest
"pooblic". The prisoner's explanation was
that he had been given the shilling without his
having asked for it, and that he had gone to the
tavern to get bread and cheese, which he greatly
needed, and a glass of beer. The magistrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
rather rebuked the policeman for referring to the
visit to the public house as counting against the
man, adding that anybody had the perfect right
to do as he had. Then, addressing the prisoner,
he said, kindly, that he was by no means sure
that actual solicitation by words was essential to
constitute begging and that his mere appearance
was an appeal. It seemed as though the man
was about to get off, when the inevitable question
"Is he known?" brought the information that he
had been in Court upon the same charge on
February 19th, on March 5th and again the
month following. The magistrate's manner
quickly changed, as he recognized an old offender,
"Three months hard labor," he said, and
"three hard" was repeated like an echo down
the corridor as the prisoner slunk back to the
cells.</p>

<p>The next was a well-dressed young man, apparently
a clerk, charged with being drunk and
disorderly.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Prisoner</i>: "It's quoite roight what the constable
says."</p>

<p><i>Magistrate</i>: "Seven shillings and sixpence or
six days."</p>

<p><i>A voice down the corridor</i>: "Seven and six or
six."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>After the early business, which is dispatched
with great rapidity, come the more serious cases,
which, if well-founded, are to be held for trial.
An American was charged with obtaining money
and goods by false pretence. Soliciting advertisements
from tradespeople for a book intended
for Americans visiting London, which never was
published; he had obtained money on account and
at the same time, procured millinery and garments
for a woman whom he introduced as his
fiancée. He was represented by a barrister who
would try his case if he were held for trial. The
witnesses consisted of milliners and dressmakers
who detailed the method of his operations. The
magistrate referred frequently to the memoranda
of their evidence, taken at the police station, and
questioned them so as to elicit their testimony,
which he wrote down in longhand. The defendant's
barrister cross-examined and the magistrate
added the substance of the cross-examination to
the deposition which was finally signed by the
witness, to be used by the trial judge as his guide,
if the grand jury should find a true bill. During
the examination, one was struck by the alacrity,
and glibness of the replies, as in all London courts
of whatever degree. An American ear is impressed
by the thought that possibly these people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
living in a densely packed community of five
millions, all speaking one language, are particularly
facile in the use of the mother tongue, unlike
the English rustic who is apt to be taciturn
and awkward of speech. One is also struck, as
in all courts, by a certain ring of sincerity, an
attitude of respect for the administration of law
and the quick and cheerful co-operation of all
concerned. The Englishman truly appears to the
best advantage in his court, where he leads the
world.</p>

<p>If the accused be held for trial by the magistrate,
the next step, as with us, is the presentation
of the charge to the grand jury. The grand
jury either throw out the indictment or find a
true bill, in which event a jury trial follows at
the Central Criminal Court.</p>

<h3>THE CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT;&mdash;THE
OLD BAILEY</h3>

<blockquote><p>CURRENT TRIALS.</p></blockquote>


<p>At the corner of Newgate and Old Bailey
streets, near Fleet street and not far from Ludgate
Hill, stands a modern building, officially
known as the Central Criminal Court, but popularly
called "the Old Bailey." It occupies the
site of the ancient Newgate Gaol and Fleet Prison,
where, for nearly seven centuries the criminals
of London expiated their crimes. There
they were tried and, if convicted, hanged on the
premises, or&mdash;a scarcely better fate&mdash;thrown into
Newgate Prison, which, from time immemorial,
was so overcrowded, so ill-ventilated and so poorly
supplied with water that it was the hot-bed
of diseases designated as "prison fever." At a
single session of court the fever had been known
to carry off fifty human beings; not only prisoners,
but such august personages as judges, mayors,
aldermen and sheriffs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>

The present fine structure is exclusively a
court house to which prisoners are brought for
trial and confined in sanitary cells beneath the
court rooms only while awaiting the call of their
cases. There are three courts: two presided over
by judges called, respectively, the Common Serjeant
and the Recorder, together with the Lord
Chief Justice of England, or such other judge of
the High Court as may be designated for the
month, who comes from his civil work in the
Strand Law Courts to try criminal cases at the
Old Bailey. Each month, also, two or three
Aldermen and Sheriffs of the City of London
are scheduled for the complimentary duty of attending
their Lordships and entertaining them
at luncheon.</p>

<p>The court rooms are rather small and nearly
square. Like every London court, they have
oak panelled walls, and excellent illumination
from above by skylights; they are arranged with
a high dais&mdash;on which are the chairs and desks
for the presiding judge, the sheriffs, or for any
guest&mdash;and they have the usual steep upward
slope of the benches for barristers on the one
side and for the jury on the other. Only the
solicitors' table is at the floor level. This arrangement
brings all the participants in a trial
more nearly together than if they were distributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
over a flat floor. At the end of the room
farthest from the judge is the prisoners' dock,
a large square box, elevated almost to the judge's
level. This the prisoner reaches by a stairway
from the cells below (invisible because of the sides
of the dock), accompanied by officers, and he
stands throughout the trial&mdash;unless invited by
the judge to be seated&mdash;completely isolated from
his barrister and from his solicitor and can only
communicate with his defenders by scrawling a
lead pencil note and passing it to an officer. A
small area of sloping benches, together with a
very inadequate gallery, are the only accommodations
for the public.</p>

<p>If the visitor happens to be a guest of the
Court, he will be ushered in by a door leading to
the raised dais and will sit at a desk beside the
judge. His eye will first be arrested by a small
heap on his desk of dried aromatic herbs and rose
leaves and, while speculating as to the purpose of
these, he will discover similar little piles on the
desks of the presiding judge and sheriffs. He
will also observe that the carpet of the dais is
thickly strewn with the same litter. Vaguely
it is suggested that the court room has been used
over night for some kind of a horticultural exhibition
and that the sweeping has been overlooked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Later, his astonishment, however, is
redoubled when enter the sheriffs and the judge
each carrying a bright colored bouquet of roses
or sweet peas bound up in an old-fashioned, stiff,
perforated paper holder. The visitor ventures to
whisper his curiosity and he is then informed that,
in the former times, these herbs, and the perfume
of fresh flowers, were supposed to prevent the
contagion of prison fever; and that the ancient
custom has survived the use of disinfectants and
the modern sanitation of prisoners and cells.</p>

<p>The opening of court in the morning and after
luncheon is a curious ceremony. The Bar and
audience rise and, through a door corresponding
to the one by which the visitor has reached the
dais, enter the two sheriffs gowned in flowing
dark blue robes trimmed with fur. Then comes
the under-sheriff in a very smart black velvet
knee breeches suit, white ruffled shirt, white stockings,
silver buckled shoes, cocked hat under arm
and sword at side. The sheriffs bow in ushering
to his seat the judge, who is arrayed in wig and
robe, which, in the case of the Lord Chief Justice,
or one of the judges of the High Court, is of
brilliant scarlet with a dark blue sash over one
shoulder, or in the case of the Common Sergeant,
is of sombre black. Each member of the court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
carries the bouquet referred to and the whole
group afford a dash of color strong in contrast
with the dark setting. The judge, having seated
himself in a chair&mdash;so cumbersome as to require
a little track to roll it forward sufficiently close to
the desk&mdash;the sheriffs dispose themselves in the
seats not occupied by the judge or his guest, and,
later, they quietly withdraw. They have no part
in the proceedings, their only function being to
usher in and out the judges, and to entertain
them at luncheon&mdash;the judges being by custom
their guests. The judge having taken his seat,
the Bar and public do the same and the business
begins. There are usually two such courts
sitting at the Old Bailey&mdash;sometimes three of
them.</p>

<p>At lunch time the sheriffs again escort the
judges from their seats, and all the judges, sheriffs
and under-sheriffs, and any guests they may
invite, assemble in the dining-room of the court
house for an excellent, substantial luncheon
served by butler and footman in blue liveries with
brass buttons, knee breeches and white stockings.
The luncheon table looks odd with the
varied costumes, the rich blues, the bright scarlets
and the wigs of the party, who, no longer on
duty, relax into jolly sociability. Indeed one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
can not escape the impression that he has in some
way joined a group of "supes" from the opera
who are snatching a light supper between the
choruses. These are some of the picturesque features
of the Old Bailey which, at the same time,
is the theatre of the most sensible and enlightened
application of law to the every day affairs
of the largest aggregation of human beings the
world has ever seen.</p>

<p>While enjoying a cigar after luncheon with
one of the under-sheriffs, the voice of the Common
Serjeant or Recorder is heard at the door
of the smoking room. Robed and armed with his
bouquet, he smilingly inquires if there are no
sheriffs to escort him into court. A hasty buckling
on of sword, a snatching up of his bouquet
and a little dusting of cigar ashes from his velvet
knee breeches, prepares the under-sheriff for the
function, and, preceded by the sheriffs in their
blue gowns, his Lordship bringing up the rear,
the little procession starts along the corridor and
enters the door leading to the judges' dais. The
under-sheriff shortly returns to finish his cigar
but the guest tarries beside the judge.</p>

<p>The first case was a minor one&mdash;a charge of
breaking and entering a shop and stealing some
goods. His name having been called, the prisoner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
suddenly popped up into the dock at the far
end of the room with police officers on either side
of him. Asked if he objected to any of the jurors
already seated in the box, he replied in the negative
and the trial began. The junior barrister
opened very briefly, merely stating the name,
date, locality and nature of the charge. Following
him the senior barrister gave the details at
much greater length. These barristers were not,
as with us, district attorneys or state prosecutors.
They are either retained by the Treasury or, as
the case may be, represent private prosecutors.
The judge was fully conversant with the evidence,
as he had before him the depositions taken
at the Magistrate's Court.</p>

<p>In an English court, when counsel has finished
the direct examination of a witness, he does not
say, as we do, "cross-examine" or "the witness
is yours", he simply resumes his seat as the signal
for the other side to cross-examine. Sometimes,
a pause of the voice simultaneously with a stooping
of the barrister's head for a word of suggestion
from the solicitor below, leads his opponent to believe
he is seating himself and to begin to cross-examine
prematurely.</p>

<p>Although in this case the plea was "not guilty,"
the charge was practically undefended, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
prompt verdict of "guilty" followed. Then came
the important query from the judge to the
police as to whether the prisoner "is known"&mdash;was
there a record of former convictions? Learning
that there was not, a sentence to eighteen
calendar months at hard labor followed a caution
that if he should be brought again before the
court, he would be sent to penal servitude.
With a servile "If your Lordship pleases" he
turned to dive down the stairs, and, as he did so,
with a grinning leer, seized his left hand in his
right and cordially shook hands with himself&mdash;a
bit of a gesticular slang which led one to think
that the police were not very well informed as to
his previous experiences.</p>

<p>The next was a more important case. A clever
but sinister-looking Belgian, the master of several
languages, was charged with obtaining a valuable
pair of diamond earrings by an ingenious
swindle. Having a slight acquaintance with a
dealer in stones, he telephoned that a friend of
his was coming over to London from Paris to
join his wife and desired to present her with a
pair of earrings. If the dealer had suitable
stones and would allow a commission, the Belgian
said he would try to effect a sale for him. He,
therefore, arranged that the dealer, at a fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hour the following day, should bring the stones
to his lodgings for the Frenchman's inspection.
The appointment was kept and the two men
waited for some time for the Frenchman. Finally
the latter's wife appeared and explained to
the Belgian in French&mdash;which the Englishman
did not understand&mdash;that her husband had been
detained but would come by a later train, whereupon
she withdrew, and the conversation was
interpreted to the disappointed dealer.</p>

<p>Then the Belgian suggested that, if the dealer
cared to leave the stones, he would give a receipt
for them and would either return them or the
money by half-past four. The dealer replied that
although he was quite willing to do so, he had
partners whose interest he must consult. The
Belgian then produced a certificate of stock in
some Newfoundland Company, saying that it was
worth as much as the diamonds. The dealer consented
to receive this as security and he then left.
Just before half-past four he was called up on the
telephone and told by the Belgian that he had
made the sale and had received the money in
French notes which he would have changed into
English money. The dealer told him to bring
the French notes, which would be acceptable to
him. That, of course, was the last he ever saw of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the money, the diamonds or the swindler, until
the latter was arrested some months later.</p>

<p>The leading nature of the direct examination,
so marked in all English courts, was conspicuous
in such questions as the following:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q</i>: "Did the defendant telephone you about
4.15?"</p>

<p><i>A</i>: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p><i>Q</i>: "Did you recognize his voice?"</p>

<p><i>A</i>: "Yes, sir."</p>

<p><i>Q</i>: "Did you send an assistant to the defendant's
flat with a letter and was it returned to you
unopened?"</p>

<p><i>A</i>: "Yes, sir."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Secretary of the Newfoundland Company
having been called, was asked: "Were the
shares in defendant's name formerly in the name
of John Smith?" <i>A</i>: "Yes." <i>Q</i>: "Was there an
order of court forbidding their transfer?"
<i>A</i>: "Yes."</p>

<p>Two pawnbrokers testified that, shortly after
four o'clock, the prisoner had brought the earrings
to their shops and asked how much would be
loaned upon them and that, the sum offered being
apparently unsatisfactory, the Belgian took the
earrings away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Defendant's barrister</i>: "My Lord, I submit, I've
no case to answer."</p>

<p><i>The Court</i>: "Oh, yes, you have."</p>

<p><i>Barrister</i>: "Well, if your Lordship thinks so."</p></blockquote>

<p>The defence was cleverer than the original swindle
in that it did not attempt to deny the overwhelming
evidence, but merely made the story
tally with an ostensibly innocent explanation.
The Belgian averred that he had himself been
robbed by the Frenchman, with whom he had
but a slight acquaintance gained at the Paris
races. He said that the Frenchman had kept
the deferred appointment and, though he admired
the stones, he thought them hardly worth
the price, whereupon the two had set off in a cab
to obtain an opinion as to their value. If thus
assured, he was to make the purchase and together
they were to take them to his wife in a
hotel near Piccadilly. As it was late in the day,
they failed to find a French-speaking jeweller
whom they sought, and it was suggested that, as
pawnbrokers were very cautious in loaning, two
opinions of that fraternity should be had. On
stopping at the pawnbrokers' shops, the Frenchman,
being ignorant of English, said there was
no use of his going in as he would have to rely
upon his companion's interpretation and might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as well sit in the cab. Thus, the visits by the Belgian
alone to the two pawnshops and the inquiry
as to the amount procurable as a loan, were duly
accounted for.</p>

<p>According to the prisoner's story, the Frenchman,
being satisfied, proposed to pay in French
notes and the Belgian entered a public telephone
booth to enquire of his principal if that would be
satisfactory, leaving the jewels with the Frenchman
in the cab. When he returned the cab was
gone.</p>

<p>His intention having been to leave for the Continent
the following day, the Belgian said he had
already notified the landlord of his flat&mdash;which
was apparently true&mdash;and had dispatched his
effects in advance. So, supposing that the
Frenchman had gone to Paris, he immediately
followed on the evening train in the hope of
identifying him en route, or of finding him somewhere
in that city. He swore he did find him
a few days later and caused his arrest, and that
the French magistrate declined to hold him because
the crime had been committed in England
where there was no warrant out, and, hence, no
demand for extradition.</p>

<p>The weakest point in this ingenious fabrication
was the prisoner's failure to communicate with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the owner of the diamonds during the ensuing
five months. This, and other discrepancies, having
been easily laid bare on cross-examination, a
verdict of guilty was quickly rendered.</p>

<p>The judge had hardly uttered the usual query
whether the prisoner was known, before an alert
police inspector replied, "He is an international
swindler, well-known all over the Continent,
wanted in Berlin for a job of 20,000 marks, in
Paris for another of 30,000 francs and elsewhere."</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Judge</i>: "Suppose we give him a few months and
allow the foreign police to apply for extradition?"</p>

<p><i>Inspector</i>: "Well, Your Lordship, the trouble
is that he claims to have been born in Paris
of English parents and that he is, therefore,
a British subject, and the French police will
jolly well accept his statement."</p>

<p><i>Judge</i>: "That's very awkward. We'll give him
twelve calendar months and see what transpires."</p></blockquote>

<h3>AN IMPORTANT MURDER TRIAL</h3>


<p>Amongst the murder trials on the "Calendar
of Prisoners" appeared "No 38; Madar Lal
Dhingra, 25, Student, wilful murder of Sir William
Hutt Curzon Wyllie and Dr. Cowas Lalcaca."
This referred to the cowardly assassination
of an English gentleman who had devoted
his life to Indian administration and to benefiting
the native races of that country, and to the murder
of an Indian doctor, who lost his life in an
effort to save him. The tragedy, the news of
which had profoundly shocked the world less
than three weeks before, occurred during an
evening reception at the Imperial Institute. The
prisoner, a fanatical Indian student, was believed
to have borne no personal animosity to his
victim.</p>

<p>No one knew exactly when the case would be
reached, but it had been expected for several
days when, one morning, the Old Bailey, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
view of a possible disturbance by Indian sympathizers,
was found to be carefully guarded by detectives.
Except a small audience admitted by
cards which were doubtless hard to procure and
not transferable, the public, clamoring at the
doors, were excluded from the Court, although
one American lady, who appeared in one of the
back seats, seemed to have had information and
influence necessary to gain an entrée.</p>

<p>The barristers' benches, however, were so full
that there was an unusual array of bewigged
heads on that side of the court. The jury, already
in place, and the small audience, waited in
quiet but tense expectation. While one was idly
noting the usual dried herbs and rose leaves on
the desks and carpet of the judges' dais, the Lord
Chief Justice seated himself and rolled his chair
forward, a shaft of soft sun rays from the skylight
accentuating his scarlet robe. The sheriffs
bowed and took their seats at the side, and Dhingra's
name was called.</p>

<p>Into the dock at the far end of the room
popped the prisoner, guarded by two imperturbable
policemen. He was a little, yellow
youth with a Semitic or Oriental countenance,
silky black hair much dishevelled and
badly in need of the scissors, and eyes, so far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
they were discernible under his gold-rimmed
spectacles, of glittering black. He wore an ordinary
gray suit and stood with his right hand
thrust into the breast of his coat, suggesting that
he had concealed there some weapon or, perhaps,
poison; but of course he had long since been disarmed
and under careful guard. His was a
meagre figure, by no means conveying to an observer
his own conceited estimate of his personality.
When he spoke, though posing as a hero
and martyr, he revealed only a sullen, sulky and
venomous disposition and the ferocity of his
character was attested by the premeditated and
treacherous murder which he had committed.</p>

<p>The Clerk of Arraigns having asked whether
the prisoner pleaded guilty or not guilty, his reply
was at first not understood because of his
broken English and his quick, spasmodic utterance.
So his answer had to be repeated, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Prisoner</i>: "First of all, I would say these words
can not be used with regard to me at all.
Whatever I did was an act of patriotism
which was justified. The only thing I have
got to say is contained in that statement,
which I believe you have got."</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>: "The only question is whether you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
plead guilty or not guilty to this indictment."</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>: "Well, according to my view I will
plead not guilty."</p>

<p><i>The Clerk</i>: "Are you defended by counsel?"</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>: "No."</p></blockquote>

<p>There were three barristers for the prosecution,
including the Attorney General who chiefly conducted
the case. The Lord Chief Justice volunteered
leave to the prisoner to sit down, which he
did, appearing more diminutive than ever, in contrast
with his guardians. The junior barrister
having stated the names, the date and locality of
the crime very briefly, the Attorney General
opened the case for the prosecution in great detail,
consuming a third of the ninety minutes
which elapsed before sentence of death. In his
opening, as is usual in England, he produced
exhibits and read letters not yet offered in evidence.</p>

<p>In substance it was related that Dhingra
came to England about three years before to
study engineering and fell into the association
of India House, a rendezvous in London of Indians
of seditious proclivities. He lived in lodgings
where he had few visitors and where, after
the murder, was found a letter from Sir Curzon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Wyllie which was read in the opening speech and
which stated that the prisoner had been commended
to the writer's protection and offered to
be of service to him while in England. The story
was told of his procuring a license to carry a
weapon, of his purchase of a Colt's automatic
magazine revolver and another revolver, of cartridges
and of a long dagger&mdash;all of which were
produced by the speaker and the triggers of the
empty pistols snapped to show the jury how they
worked.</p>

<p>An account of his frequent practice at a pistol
gallery for three months and up to the very
afternoon of the day of the tragedy and the use
of a target the size of a man's head, preceded an
exhibition of the last paper target used, when
four bullets out of the five had pierced the bull's
eye. The speaker described how Dhingra had
called his victim aside into a vestibule while Lady
Wyllie proceeded down the staircase, how he
fired four shots pointblank, which passed
through Sir Curzon's head; how Dr. Lalcaca had
tried to intervene and was shot for his temerity,
and how, finally, an elderly English baronet had
grappled with the murderer and succeeded in
wresting the revolver from him and bearing him
to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The witnesses were then called and examined
with great rapidity, the judge restricting their
testimony to essentials and checking both counsel
and witness from the slightest digression. This
seemed to be carried almost to an extreme, as an
untrained witness often brings forth an important
fact amid much irrelevant verbosity. At
the end of the direct examination of the first witness,
his Lordship asked Dhingra if he wished
to cross-examine. The latter growled a negative
but added that he had something to say, whereupon
he was informed that he would have an opportunity
for that later. Thereafter, when asked
the same question at the conclusion of each witness'
evidence, he merely shook his head.</p>

<p>The prosecution having rested, Dhingra was
asked if he had any witnesses and replied that
he had not. The Lord Chief Justice then informed
him that if he had anything to say, now
would be his chance, and asked whether he desired
to speak where he was&mdash;from the dock&mdash;or from
the stand. The judge of course referred to the
difference between a mere unsworn statement
which might be in the nature of a plea to the jury
to add a recommendation for mercy to their verdict,
or, sworn testimony which might go to the
merits of guilt or innocence. It was apparent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
that the prisoner, as he was without counsel, did
not understand this question and, as well, that
the judge did not comprehend his inability to
grasp a distinction indicated in the question.
Doubtless, as the prisoner was bound to be
hanged&mdash;and he richly deserved it&mdash;the misunderstanding
made not the slightest difference in
this case, but one could not help feeling that the
failure to provide counsel was a serious defect
in the administration of justice.</p>

<p>Dhingra elected to remain in the dock and
stated that he was unable to remember all he
wanted to say, but that he had committed it to a
writing which was in the possession of the police.
This was then read by the Clerk but so falteringly
owing to the manuscript being illegible, that the
effect of the revolutionary diatribe was largely
lost. The London <i>Times</i>, however, printed it the
next day as follows:</p>

<p>"I do not want to say anything in defence of
myself, but simply to prove the justice of my
deed. For myself I do not think any English
law court has got any authority to arrest me, or
to detain me in prison, or to pass sentence of
death upon me. That is the reason why I did
not have any counsel to defend me. I maintain
that if it would be patriotic in an Englishman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to fight against the Germans, if they were to
occupy this country, it is much more justifiable
and patriotic in my case to fight against the English.
I hold the English people responsible for
the murder of eighty millions of my countrymen
in the last fifty years, and they are also responsible
for taking away £100,000,000 every year
from India to this country.</p>

<p>"I also hold them responsible for the hanging
and deportation of my patriotic countrymen,
who do just the same as the English people here
are advising their countrymen to do. An Englishman
who goes out to India and gets, say,
£100 a month, simply passes the sentence of
death upon one thousand of my poor countrymen
who could live on that £100 a month, which
the Englishman spends mostly on his frivolities
and pleasures.</p>

<p>"Just as the Germans have got no right to occupy
this country, so the English people have no
right to occupy India, and it is perfectly justifiable
on our part to kill an Englishman who is
polluting our sacred land.</p>

<p>"I am surprised at the terrible hypocrisy, farce,
and mockery of the English people when they
pose as champions of oppressed humanity such as
in the case of the people of the Congo and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Russia, while there is such terrible oppression and
such horrible atrocities in India. For example,
they kill 2,000,000 of our people every year and
outrage our women. If this country is occupied
by Germans and an Englishman, not bearing to
see the Germans walking with the insolence of
conquerors in the streets of London, goes and
kills one or two Germans, then, if that Englishman
is held as a patriot by the people of this
country, then certainly I am a patriot too, working
for the emancipation of my Motherland.
Whatever else I have to say is in the statement
now in the possession of the court. I make this
statement, not because I wish to plead for mercy
or anything of that kind. I wish the English
people will sentence me to death, for in that case
the vengeance of my countrymen will be all the
more keen. I put forward this statement to show
the justice of my cause to the outside world, especially
to our sympathizers in America and Germany.
That is all."</p>

<p>His Lordship then asked the prisoner if he
wished to say anything more.</p>

<p>The prisoner at first said "No", but just as
the Lord Chief Justice was commencing to sum
up the case to the jury, Dhingra said there was
another statement on foolscap paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>His Lordship</i>: "Any other statement you must
make now yourself."</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>: "I do not remember it now."</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i>: "You must make any statement
you wish to the jury. If there is anything,
say it now."</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>: "It was taken from my pocket amongst
other papers."</p>

<p><i>His Lordship</i>: "I do not care what was in your
pocket. With what you had written before,
we have nothing to do. You can say anything
you wish to the jury. What you have
written on previous occasions is no evidence
in this case. If you wish to say anything
to the jury in defence of yourself, say it
now. Do you wish to say anything more?"</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i>: "No."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Lord Chief Justice then summed up the
case to the jury in a charge occupying but six
minutes. He said that the evidence was absolutely
conclusive; that the jury had no concern
with any political justification for the crime,
for if anything of the kind were considered it
would be in the carrying of the sentence into effect&mdash;with
which the jury had nothing to do&mdash;that
this was an ordinary crime by which a blameless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
man, who had devoted himself to the public
service and had done much for the natives of
India, had lost his life, and that it was quite plain
there had been premeditation. His Lordship
added that there was nothing which could induce
the jury to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter,
nor was it suggested that Dhingra
was insane, so that if the jury believed the uncontradicted
evidence the only possible verdict
was one of wilful murder.</p>

<p>Without leaving the box the jury put their
heads together and, in less than a minute, the
foreman arose and uttered the fateful word
"Guilty."</p>

<p>There are no degrees of murder in England,
but in cases where a weak intellect or greatly
extenuating circumstances render hanging too
severe a penalty, the Home Secretary may exercise
a power of commutation. Thereupon Dhingra
having been ordered to stand up, the clerk
addressed him as follows: "You stand convicted
of the crime of wilful murder. Have you anything
to say for yourself, why sentence of death
should not be passed on you according to law?"</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Prisoner</i>: (with a snarl) "I have told you once
I do not acknowledge the authority of the
Court. You can do whatever you like with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
me&mdash;I do not care. Remember, one day we
shall be all-powerful, and then we can do
what we like."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then followed absolute silence for two minutes&mdash;a
silence in which the breathing of persons
near was audible.</p>

<p>Slowly the Lord Chief Justice lifted from his
desk a piece of black cloth. It was the "Black
Cap." One naturally thinks, from its name, that
this is a kind of headgear corresponding to the
shape of a man's head. On the contrary, it looks
like a piece of plain limp cloth, a remnant from a
tailor's shop, about a foot square, which the judge
places on the top of his wig, letting it rest there
quite casually and perhaps at a rakish angle, the
four corners hanging down and the whole producing
a somewhat ludicrous effect. Neither judge,
jury, nor audience, rose when sentence was about
to be pronounced, but all remained seated, except
the prisoner, who stood in dreary isolation,
flanked by his stalwart guard, at his elevated
station in the dock. His Lordship, the dignity of
whose well-modulated voice contrasted strongly
with his comical head covering, slowly addressed
the prisoner as follows:</p>

<hr class="hr65" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i181.png" width="600" height="444" alt="The Sentencing of Dhingra" title="The Sentencing of Dhingra" />
<span class="caption">The Sentencing of Dhingra</span>
</div>
<hr class="hr65"/>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madar Lal Dhingra, no words of mine can
have the slightest effect upon you, nor do I intend
to say anything more than to point out to
you that you have been convicted upon the clearest
possible evidence of the brutal murder of an
innocent man. The law enforces upon me to
pass the only possible sentence in such a case."</p>

<p>The sentence was that the prisoner should be
hanged by the neck until he was dead and be
buried at the place of execution.</p>

<p>The Chaplain, in his robes, having somehow
appeared at his Lordship's side, added: "Amen.
And may God have mercy upon your soul."</p>

<p>Immediately after the dread words had been
uttered, the prisoner saluted the grave judge by
a salaam, bringing the back of his hand to his
forehead, and said in a manner, the impertinence
of which deprived his words of dignity: "Thank
you, my Lord. I am proud to have the honor
of laying down my life for my country. I do not
care."</p>

<p>Counsel representing the relatives of the condemned
man then arose and said that he was instructed
to say that they viewed the crime with
the greatest abhorrence and wished to repudiate
in the most emphatic way the slightest sympathy
with the views and motives which had led to it,
adding, on behalf of the father and family, that
there were no more loyal subjects of the Empire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
than themselves. His Lordship replied that,
while the course might seem somewhat unusual,
yet, having regard to the wicked attempt at justification
in some quarters, he was glad for what
had been said on behalf of the members of the
family.</p>

<p>Dhingra and his guards then disappeared
from the dock and in a few moments the Lord
Chief Justice and his escort, as well as the small
audience, had withdrawn, leaving the court room
deserted except for a newspaper reporter who
was completing his notes. And so the drama
closed.</p>

<p>One was told that the youthful student would
probably be hanged in a fortnight from the following
Tuesday&mdash;the trial having taken place on
a Friday&mdash;as ancient custom entitled the condemned
man to three Sundays of life after sentence.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>The spectacle of this little, lonely, misguided,
yellow man, prompted partly by fanaticism but
largely by vanity, having braved the whole power
of mighty Britain in its proud capital to exploit
his chimerical views, caught in the meshes of a
law he hardly understood and hemmed in on all
sides by its remorseless ministers, was deeply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
interesting and somewhat calculated to excite
sympathy, until one's reason summoned the significance
of the treacherous murder and the picture
of a fair Englishwoman going out into that
London night a widow.</p>

<p>While the result of this trial was justice, swift
and unerring, to an American observer it seemed
odd and scarcely a fair practice for a man to be
tried for his life unrepresented by counsel learned
in the law. Although the case was plain, nevertheless,
with great respect for the admirable administration
of the law in England, it must be
remarked that innocent persons,&mdash;who, even if
not mentally defective, may none the less be far
from clever and who are necessarily inexperienced,
and may perhaps lack the intelligence or
means to retain counsel&mdash;ought not to be permitted
by the court to pit their wits against an
able officer of the crown, the stake being their
own necks. To excuse the omission on the
ground of the obvious guilt and callousness of
the prisoner, is not a satisfactory solution, because
it would involve prejudging the issue to be
tried. The proper and humane course is followed
in the United States&mdash;the appointment by
the court of counsel for an undefended prisoner&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
it guards against the possibility of terrible
mistakes.</p>

<p>From a technical point of view, the "leading"
nature of the direct examinations, so noticeable
in English courts, was especially conspicuous in
that this was a murder trial where no departure
from the recognized customs would have been
permitted. One's ear grows accustomed to questions
which put the answer into the mouth of the
witness and require merely a monosyllabic assent;
and one waits in vain for the objection
which, at home, would follow such infractions of
the rules of evidence as thunder succeeds lightning.
In the Dhingra trial, for instance, the Attorney
General did not scruple to ask such questions
as the following:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q</i>: "Did you happen to look through the doorway
and into the vestibule and see the prisoner
speaking to Sir Curzon Wyllie and
did you see him raise his hand and fire four
shots into his face, the pistol almost touching
him?"</p>

<p><i>Q</i>: "Did you see Sir Curzon Wyllie collapse?"</p>

<p><i>Q</i>: "Then, was there an interval of some seconds
and then more shots?" (These killed Dr.
Lalcaca.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Nor did he hesitate to put such questions to another
witness as:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q</i>: "Did you hear the noise of four shots and did
you then look and see the prisoner and did
you see him shoot again?"</p></blockquote>

<p>A police officer was asked:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q</i>: "Did you examine the pistol and find one
undischarged cartridge only?"</p>

<p><i>Q</i>: "Had the other pistol six undischarged cartridges
in it?"</p>

<p><i>Q</i>: "Did you find two bullets similar to these in
the wall?"</p></blockquote>

<p>To such an extent was leading carried in the
Dhingra trial that occasionally the answer did
not follow the lead, thus:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Q</i>: "Did you ask him 'What is your name and
where do you live?'"</p>

<p><i>A</i>: "I can't remember what I asked him."</p></blockquote>

<p>The probable reason for the great latitude in
this regard is the fact that apparently nothing in
an English trial is a surprise&mdash;except to the jury.
The court and counsel, knowing practically all
the evidence beforehand, are extremely lenient.</p>

<p>Not only are leading questions common but
also questions asking for conclusions&mdash;not for
facts from which the jury may draw their own
deductions. Thus, in the Dhingra trial, a doctor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
who was sent for after the murder, was
asked: "Did the prisoner seem calm, quiet and
collected?" A plaintiff, perhaps, will be asked:
"How came the defendant to write this letter and
what was its object? Did he consider himself
remiss?" Of course an American lawyer would
successfully contend that a letter speaks for itself,
while a man's estimate of his own position
could only be put in evidence by repeating his
admissions in that regard&mdash;not by asking his opponent
how he regarded himself.</p>

<p>In favor of the practice of asking witnesses
for conclusions&mdash;a practice which many American
lawyers have found invalidates parts of testimony
taken in England for use here&mdash;much may
be said. To ask a witness the mental attitude of
a person, whom he heard talking a year before&mdash;whether
he was angry, or joking, for example&mdash;is
to ask an answerable question; but to require
him to repeat the exact words, is to demand an
impossibility. In replying to either form of inquiry
the witness may be honest or the reverse,
so that the chances of intentional misinformation
are equally balanced, but an attempt at verbatim
repetition nearly always requires, consciously
or unconsciously, a draft upon the imagination.
It seems that our rules of evidence in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
this regard might, perhaps, be cautiously relaxed
with advantage, to accord more with practical experience.</p>

<p>An English criminal trial is quick, simple and
direct. Dhingra, for example, whose crime was
committed on July first, was sentenced on the
twenty-first of that month and was hanged on
August seventeenth&mdash;all in forty-seven days.
The simplicity and directness of such trials is due
to the absence of irrelevant testimony and imaginative
arguments; these, counsel scarcely ever
attempt to introduce&mdash;so certain is their exclusion
by the judge. Thus, the real object of all
punishment&mdash;its deterrent effect upon others&mdash;is
greatly enhanced because it is swift and sure.
The public, moreover, are usually spared the
scandal and demoralizing effects of prolonged,
spectacular and sensational trials.</p>

<p>Until a short time ago any person convicted in
an English court was without appeal&mdash;the rulings
and sentence of a single judge were final&mdash;but
this manifest injustice has lately been cured by
a law granting the right of appeal. It is too soon
to estimate the effect of this change, but the prediction
may be ventured that the ancient habit
of regarding criminal judgments as conclusive,
together with the saving common sense which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
characterizes all English courts, will probably
prevent any radical departure from the present
methods, which have much to commend them.</p>

<p>Comparison with American conditions is most
difficult because, besides the United States courts
extending for certain purposes over the whole
country, there are forty-six absolutely separate
sovereignties whose administration of criminal
law, unless in conflict with the Constitution of
the United States, is as independent of the rest
of the world as that of an empire. Consequently,
while differences exist in methods and results,
the remarkable fact is that they are, upon the
whole, so similar, when only a common tradition
and a fairly homogeneous public opinion serve
to keep them from drifting in diverse directions.</p>

<p>The administration of criminal law by the
United States Courts deals chiefly with the trial
of persons accused of murder on the high seas,
counterfeiting, forgery, smuggling or postal
frauds, defaulting bank officials and, very lately,
corporation managers charged with favoritism in
freight rates, or with the maintenance of monopolies
affecting interstate commerce. Throughout
the length and breadth of the land it is prompt,
thoroughly dignified, vigorous and fair; indeed,
its excellence, as a whole, suffers little if at all by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
comparison with the best English standards,
which have been perfected only by centuries
of experience in the highly concentrated population
of a small Island.</p>

<p>But turning to the individual States, all comparisons
must depend upon locality. New York,
the landing place, that threshold of real America,
with a predominating foreign population; the
western frontiers of civilization, and the South,
with its peculiar racial conditions, suffer by comparison
with British standards far more than
would one of the orderly communities composing
the greater part of the Republic.</p>

<p>Recent mal-administration of criminal law in
New York constitutes a subject of national
mortification, but the existence of this sensitiveness
is the best of reasons for believing that time
will bring an improvement. Unfortunately for
the good name of the country, foreigners do not
comprehend, and can hardly be made to appreciate,
that the instances of private assassination
in that city followed by trials, which, whether
owing to a vicious system of practice or to judicial
incompetency, excite the indignation and ridicule
of the world, are not typical of America but are
expressions of purely local and probably temporary
conditions. Foreign critics should be told that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
New York is not America, as many of them assume,
and that temporary and local lapses do not
prove a low standard. They may also be reminded,
as showing that human justice is fallible,
that even in London if a man walks into an Oxford
Street department store, lies in wait for the
proprietor against whom he has a grievance and
blows out his brains, although he will be convicted
in a trial occupying but three hours, yet
the Home Secretary may intervene and prevent
his hanging, upon a petition signed by tens of
thousands of sentimentalists moved by the rather
illogical fact that his wife contemplates an addition
to a thus celebrated family.</p>

<p>In the far West, criminal practice is probably
neither better nor worse than in any other rough
frontier of civilization where men must largely
rely upon their own resources, rather than upon
the government, for the protection of their lives
and property. Conditions in the South are so peculiar,
owing to the sudden elevation to a legal
equality of an inferior race which is in the majority,
that no comparison with any other community
is possible. Without in the least condoning existing
conditions, it may even be said that lynching,
unlike private assassination, involves some
degree of co-operation and is the expression of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
public, rather than of individual, vengeance. The
theatre of these outrages is, moreover, sparsely
settled, beyond large cities or centres of education,
and still retains some of the features of a
frontier.</p>

<p>Throughout much the largest area, however,
constituting the solid civilization and containing
the bulk of the population of this immense country,
no such conditions exist. On the contrary,
crime is met with that steady and impartial justice,
inherited from England, which neither partakes
of the police oppression of continental countries,
nor lapses into the barbarism of the exceptional
localities above referred to. To commit deliberate
murder in one of the eastern States, such as
Pennsylvania, or Massachusetts, or in one of the
great commonwealths of the middle West, means
sure and reasonably speedy hanging.</p>

<p>But, bearing in mind the difficulty of accurate
comparisons between such diversified sections and
a compact unit like England, and endeavoring to
arrive at a general estimate, it must be conceded
that America, as a whole, has even more to learn
from England's criminal, than from her civil,
courts.</p>

<h3>LITIGATION ARISING OUTSIDE OF
LONDON</h3>

<blockquote><p>LOCAL SOLICITORS&mdash;SOLICITORS' "AGENCY
BUSINESS"&mdash;THE CIRCUITS AND ASSIZES&mdash;LOCAL
BARRISTERS&mdash;THE COUNTY COURTS&mdash;THE
REGISTRAR'S COURT.</p></blockquote>


<p>As has been said, solicitors are to be found in
every town in England, whereas barristers, with
minor exceptions to be noted, all hail from the
London Inns of Court. People living in the
country or in provincial towns, especially the
larger ones, such as Liverpool and Manchester,
of course consult local solicitors. If litigation
is contemplated, the solicitor advises his client
and conducts the sparring and negotiations
which usually precede a lawsuit. But when
actual warfare opens, the provincial solicitor
generally associates himself with a London
solicitor who is known as his "agent"; and
hence "agency business" constitutes a considerable
portion of the practice of a large firm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
town solicitors. The Manchester or Liverpool
solicitor does all the work and receives the fees
up to the time he sends the "proofs" to the agent&mdash;that
is, the documents, statements of witnesses
reduced to affidavits, and the other items of evidence&mdash;and
dispatches the witnesses to the trial in
London, which usually however, he does not attend
himself, although, of course, he sometimes
does so. The London solicitor retains the barristers,
and is thereafter in complete charge of
the case. The newspaper reports of trials of cases
from the provinces, after giving the names of the
barristers, always mention the London solicitor
as agent for the country solicitor whose name also
appears. The fees are shared from the time of association;
one-third to the country, and two-thirds
to the town solicitor. This is not unlike the manner
in which our lawyers handle business in States
other than their own&mdash;but it is much more systematized.
If, however, the provincial solicitor
prefers to await the Assizes (which he may, except
in divorce, probate, equity and some other
kinds of business) he may bring his action in the
High Court, sub-offices of which are available
throughout the country for the issuance of writs,
and, having retained a barrister, may try the
case in his own town when the judge of the High
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Court comes down from London thrice a year on
circuit.</p>

<p>These Circuits of the High Court are arranged
with regard to the volume of business and the
contiguity of centres of population, without reference
to county boundaries, and the same judge is
rarely designated to repeat his visit to a circuit
until it is reached again in regular rotation. To
some circuits, like the Northern, where the business
is very heavy, two judges are sent. At
these Assizes, both civil and criminal business
is handled, and, if there be two judges, one
court room is devoted to the former and the other
to the latter.</p>

<p>Every London barrister, early in his career,
joins a circuit. He usually selects one where he
may be somewhat known to the solicitors, and
where, perhaps, his family have property or associations.
Formerly and, in fact, long after the
advent of steam, judge and counsel "rode the
circuit"&mdash;as was done in the early days of our own
county Bars&mdash;and indeed, within the memory of
barristers still in middle life, a horse van used to
stand in one of the Temple squares to receive the
luggage, papers and books of court and Bar for
the circuit. Each circuit has its "mess" with interesting
traditions of midnight carousals and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
records of fines of bottles of port inflicted upon
members for various delinquencies. The modern
mess, besides procuring special rates at the hotels,
constitutes a sort of itinerant club; rendering
possible a discipline for breaches of professional
propriety by expulsion or denial of admission,
which is the most drastic punishment short of
disbarment.</p>

<p>A few barristers, and their number is increasing,
reside in large towns other than London and
practice exclusively at the Assizes and in the
county courts&mdash;of which something will be said
later. They are known as "locals". If successful,
however, they gravitate to the source of the
High Court&mdash;London. Thus the local solicitor,
if he decide to eschew London and an agent and
await the Assizes, has a considerable Bar from
which to pick his man.</p>

<p>A barrister never accepts a brief in a circuit
other than his own unless the solicitor has also
briefed, as his associate, a junior who is a member
of the circuit. To do so would be a gross
breach of etiquette. But if this unwritten law
be duly observed, the barrister who is a stranger
here, although a daily colleague in the London
courts, is immediately received with open arms
and made an honorary member of the mess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Court and Bar having reached and disposed
themselves in an Assize town, as a flock of birds
settle in a convenient cover, a transplantation of
a London court is effected until the disputes of
the neighborhood are resolved. An observer can
find no difference in personnel or general aspect,
except perhaps, that the provincial policemen at
the doors are not so polite and patient as the London
"bobby"&mdash;that marvel which excites the
envy, admiration and despair of conscientious
ministers of authority in the rest of Christendom.</p>

<p>If an action involve no more than £100, a solicitor
may seek the County Courts&mdash;for there
are seven of such courts for the county of
London. The advantage in so doing is chiefly in
the smaller costs, which are a serious matter to all
English litigants, and almost prohibitive to the
poor. The judge of a county court must be a
barrister of at least seven years standing and
generally hails from London. He is appointed
by the Lord Chancellor and receives a salary of
£1,500. His title in court is "Your Honor",
as distinguished from a judge of the High court,
who is addressed as "My Lord" or "Your Lordship,"
and from a magistrate, who is called "Your
Worship."</p>

<p>In the county courts, solicitors "have audience",
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that is, they may, equally with barristers,
address the court and jury; in other words, they
may be the actual trial lawyers, whereas, in the
High Court barristers alone are heard. In addressing
the court, they must wear a black gown,
but no wig. Barristers, except locals, are infrequently
seen in the county courts; the amounts
involved scarcely warrant retaining them. But,
for some years, the tendency has been to increase
the limit of jurisdiction of these courts and their
importance is steadily growing. In this connection
it may be mentioned, too, that agitation appears
to be making some progress for removing
all limitation of the jurisdiction of the county
courts with, however, a right to the defendant
to remove a cause to the High Court when more
than a certain sum is involved, thus creating a
sort of solicitor-advocate. But the outcome of
all this is, at the moment, problematical. At
present, to prevent solicitors developing into
pure advocates even in the county courts, a law
forbids one solicitor retaining another to conduct
the actual trial.</p>

<p>The Registrar's Court in a great town, like
Birmingham, will be found in the county court
building. The court room is large, but usually
contains only a few people, of the lower class, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the registrar, in black gown and wig, sits on a
raised dais. In the High Court, the American
observer has been accustomed to associate a gown
only with the barrister&mdash;never with the solicitor.
In the county courts, however, he has seen solicitors
practicing as advocates, in minor cases, and
wearing gowns; but until he visits a registrar's
court he has never seen a wig except upon the
head of a barrister or of a judge; and all judges
have once been barristers. He is therefore surprised
to learn that, notwithstanding his attire,
the registrar is a solicitor, appointed to his position
by the county judge.</p>

<p>Beside the registrar stands a man who very
rapidly passes to him numerous printed forms
upon which the registrar places a figure or two,
such as "4/6" or "7/6". This is done almost as
fast as one would deal a pack of cards. Occasionally,
there is a pause, a name is called and
some one from the audience steps forward;
whereupon brief testimony is taken as to some
small debt, claimed upon one side and denied
upon the other. Judgment for plaintiff follows
in nine cases out of ten, and then inquiry
is made by the registrar whether the defendant&mdash;or
her husband, if she be a woman&mdash;has work
or is unemployed. A figure is then placed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the printed form which is added to the pile.</p>

<p>The business dispatched is that of some large
retail tradesman. Upon payment of a small fee
in the clerk's office, summonses have been obtained
which have been served on the debtors
by a policeman, and, in most cases, the defendants
have signed their names admitting the
debt. The figures 4/6, 7/6, etc. signify the order
of the court, that 4 shillings and 6 pence, or 7
shillings and 6 pence, shall be paid monthly until
the debt is liquidated. In this way, the time
of a defendant who admits the debt is not diverted
from his work to attend court. The
claims are fixed for hearing in batches of 100
every half hour of the court's sitting, when, if
not admitted in writing, a short trial of the contested
cases ensues. In this way about 400 cases
a day are readily disposed of.</p>

<p>Payments are made in the clerk's office and
each payment is endorsed on the summons. If
the debtor falls out of work, an application is
made, invariably with success, to suspend the
payment until idleness ceases. The costs are
trifling and the whole system works admirably.
It is a prompt and businesslike manner of enforcing
small obligations with a minimum of loss and
delay.</p>

<h3>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>It is the office of the courts to administer
written laws enacted from time to time in response
to the popular mood. They also&mdash;and
it is the more important function&mdash;discover and
declare the principles of natural justice which,
in the absence of written law, govern the decision
of a controversy. These deliverances, constituting
the common law, rely much upon precedents
which, however, are not followed slavishly,
but are continually being modified&mdash;sometimes
abruptly&mdash;in harmony with prevailing
sentiment. Thus, the law expounded by the
courts is ever changing and it slowly follows
public opinion.</p>

<p>Both the public opinion and the law of England
were, for generations, characterized by the
quality of conservatism. The various reform
acts, starting in 1832, marked the advent of an
epoch of individualism which, lasting for over
fifty years, made England the land where personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
liberty and private property were perhaps
safer than ever before in the world's history. It
was a country where government's chief concern
was to furnish irreproachable courts, competent
police and few but honest civil servants, so that
each man might pursue happiness after his own
fashion with the least possible interference, yet
with complete confidence that he could assert his
rights effectively when invaded. Hence it was
that America learned to look to England for
precedents.</p>

<p>All this is changing. The substitution of
the doctrines of collectivism for those of individualism
began in 1885 and it proceeds rapidly
in many directions. The socialistic harangues
one hears from vagabonds mounted on benches in
Hyde Park are delivered without interference by
the police. The spreading of discontent by paid
agitators proceeds at the market crosses and in the
taverns of the villages between elections. Later
the politicians appear and solicit votes for impossible
schemes, an ever increasing proportion
of which are actually adopted by Parliament and
of which the laws regulating liability for personal
injuries, attacks upon land and other forms of
property, old age pensions and the methods of
public education, furnish typical examples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>

The Workingmen's Compensation and Employers'
Liability Act of 1906 was a tentative
step, but seems likely to lead to extended
liability and reduced defences, particularly in
the matter of contributory negligence, which
has almost ceased to be a factor. One of the
clauses of this Act shows that, even when it is
proved that the death or serious disablement of
a workman is attributable to his own wilful misconduct,
compensation may yet be claimed on
his behalf from his employer. In addition,
another and unheard of form of liability for
an employer, requiring him to compensate his
servant if the latter falls ill or dies of an
"industrial disease" (a list of which diseases
was appended to the Act) and with the extraordinary
provision that, having paid the
compensation, the employer may sue any
former employer for the amount, if he can
prove the servant actually contracted the complaint
in the earlier service and within ten
years.</p>

<p>Of course universal accident liability insurance
followed, the cost of which must be borne by the
proprietor, and, if he is a manufacturer, eventually
by the consumer. As may be imagined, such
laws give rise to surprising results. The report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of one of the great accident liability insurance
companies, made shortly after the passage of this
law, exhibited, for example, the recovery of damages
by a domestic servant, who, while eating
a meal, had swallowed her own false teeth; another
had contrived to swallow a curtain hook;
a third was burned by the bed clothes taking fire
from a hot iron which she had wrapped in flannel
for the purpose of warming herself. The manageress
of a laundry had her hands poisoned by
handling copper coins. A footman was bitten
while attempting to extract a cat from the jaws
of a dog; a nurse-maid was burnt by letting off
fire works in the back garden at a private celebration
of the servants during the master's absence,
and a cook had her eyes scratched by the
house cat. Such absurdities show the trend of
modern English legislation on the subject.</p>

<p>A glance at an English landscape with its
panorama of endless turf and forest and comparatively
small areas of cultivation, in marked
contrast with the minute utilization of every inch
on the Continent, and the reflection that England
produces only a portion of the food consumed
in its crowded towns, should leave no one
surprised at an agitation to modify the existing
conditions, which led to continued assaults upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
all forms of possession, whether of real or personal
property. Acts of Parliament followed
each other in quick succession depriving land
owners of their holdings to inaugurate chimerical
building schemes; giving rent-payers power
to condemn and forcibly purchase dwelling
houses; attacking property other than land by
taxing the inheritance of money so heavily (on
a sliding scale of percentages increasing with the
size of the estate), as to approach the socialistic
ideal that two deaths shall mean the absorption
by the State of any large property and that no
man shall enjoy a rich grandfather's accumulations;
levying upon the living wealthy by ever
increasing income taxes, with a like sliding scale,
operating upon them alone, while exempting the
poor. To this almost confiscatory taxation no
limit seems to be in sight.</p>

<p>Old age pensions&mdash;one of the most startling
novelties of the collectivist&mdash;are doubtless economically
impossible and morally pernicious unless
required to be contributory on the part of those
who may later claim them, so that they constitute
a system of compulsory saving and insurance, as
is the plan in Germany where socialism is at
least somewhat scientific. But it remained for
the once conservative England to inaugurate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
distribution of universal alms without any comprehensive
plan for raising the money&mdash;the weekly
dole to be inevitably increased and the age
limit lowered as the exigencies of vote-seeking
politicians render expedient.</p>

<p>No one now questions the propriety of a Government
providing free education for children,
but in England a father, no matter how well
qualified, may now be prosecuted for educating
his child himself rather than sending him to a
Government school to be fed as well as taught.</p>

<p>At the Marylebone Police Court a well known
journalist and writer on education was summoned
by the Education Department of the London
County Council some time ago for neglecting
to send his four children to school. He was, himself,
an old and experienced teacher with credentials
from one of the colleges of Cambridge University.
He did not believe in sending his children
to school until they reached the age of ten or
eleven, but meanwhile he taught them himself,
<i>viva voce</i> in the open air, according to the system
of Froebel and Pestalozzi, and endeavored to
make education a delight. This was the father's
chief occupation and he devoted as much time as
possible to training all the mental faculties, without
exhausting the nervous force or injuring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
physical health, of his children. The eldest, a
boy of fourteen, had contributed an article to
one of the leading magazines which was pronounced
by a competent editor of another periodical
to be an extraordinary effort for a boy of
his age. It appeared that he knew Shakespeare
well and was in the habit of quoting him and
other poets, but that his brother, aged eleven,
preferred Wordsworth. He considered the English
language "awkward," French "euphonious"
and German "rationally spelt." It was rather
a relief to find another brother, aged nine, who
was deep in "Robinson Crusoe." A school-attendance
officer, however, had reported that the children
did not attend the elementary schools and
the magistrate imposed fines upon the father,
but, upon it appearing that he had no property,
he was sentenced to imprisonment for seven days
in respect of the Shakespearean, and five days
each to cover the lover of Wordsworth and the
student of Defoe. A month later the father
was summoned before a different magistrate in
the same police court who fined him in respect
of the youngest child and adjourned the hearing
in order that the other three might be examined
by a government inspector to ascertain whether
they were being efficiently educated. This episode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
may not have been typical, but that it was
possible in modern England illustrates how out
of date is the old-fashioned conception of the
personal liberty and freedom from governmental
intrusion which once characterized that Island
as distinguished from the Continent.</p>

<p>These are but examples of a series of surrenders
to the proletariat, which have practically
delivered over the general Government of England
to the collectivists; while the education and
training of many of the party managers who are
responsible for it, renders incredible the excuse
that they may be only fanatics.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, municipal socialism has
spread in a manner affecting the public even
more intimately. Over three fourths of the
Councils&mdash;County, Town, Urban District and
Rural District&mdash;are engaged in municipal trading
of various kinds, operating inefficiently and
generally at a loss, such enterprises as golf links,
steamboats, concert halls, motor busses, markets,
trams, bath houses, gas works, libraries, telephones,
milk depots, electric lighting, lodging
houses, building operations, insurance&mdash;and a
host of other undertakings heretofore left to
private initiative.</p>

<p>All this means an ever increasing army of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
officials, agents and inspectors. The interference
of a paternal government is threatened or felt
in every detail of existence. The people have
learned to agitate collectively for advantages to
be taken from some classes and distributed to
others. Without a constitution (for the so-called
English Constitution is but a misnomer for
former laws and decisions which are subject to
constant repeal and alteration) and without a
Supreme Court capable of declaring wild legislation
to be unconstitutional&mdash;for every act of
Parliament becomes a law which can never be
challenged in any court&mdash;there is no brake to retard,
and the politicians of all shades are left free
to compete in casting one vested right after another
to the mob in quest of votes.</p>

<p>The most serious effect of all this is, probably,
the tendency to weaken that sturdy self-reliance
upon individual effort which has always characterized
Englishmen, and the encouragement of an
attitude of leaning upon the Government and of
looking to legislation to remove all difficulties.
No popular disturbance is impending&mdash;it is unnecessary,
for the revolution progresses smoothly
and the whole country is adjusting itself to
the new order of things. The possessors of property
seem singularly resigned, or at least inarticulate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and submit almost in silence to spoliation.
Such opposition as exists takes chiefly
the form of party controversy upon details, and
criticism by each faction of the steps of the other.
Few seem to realize how far the country has departed
from its former standards or that the
most moderate proposals of to-day were radical
yesterday.</p>

<p>It is a great race, this Anglo-Saxon, and it
has shown wonderful capacity to govern itself in
the past. It may prove to be wisely meeting
half way an approaching avalanche of worldwide
socialism destined to modify the existing order
of society. Or can it be that England has
seen its best days?</p>

<p>One thing, at least, is sure&mdash;the United States
is at the moment infinitely more conservative
than England. Both are pure democracies, and
therefore if the people should be resolved to abolish
the rights of property as we at present know
them, it would inevitably be accomplished. That
the majority are really of that mind in either country
is more than doubtful; but in England the
politicians seem to be destroying that which it
has taken centuries to build up, whereas in
America this could not happen unless the conviction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was so widespread, determined and permanent,
as to accomplish what is apparently impossible&mdash;the
radical amendment of the Constitution.</p>

<p>This digression into the field of politics is only
relevant in its possible effect upon the courts.
They, at present, necessarily exist in an atmosphere
of confusion and of constant annihilation
of rights. The head of the whole administration
of law, the Lord Chancellor, is a political appointee
changing with the parties. He appoints
the other judges, the King's Counsel and, directly
or indirectly, he is the great source of legal
advancement. True, he has for a long time been
selected from the leaders of the Bar so that he
has been professionally well qualified. But this
was not always the case and it is not necessarily a
permanent condition, especially in a country
passing through such fundamental changes.</p>

<p>Time alone will show whether these violent
shocks will disturb the balance of the scales of
justice. For the future, realizing that England
is no longer conservative, but is now the land of
startling experiment, it would be at least prudent
to accept its political and legal precedents with
caution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
One sometimes hears it said that we have too
many judges, and the argument is apt to be
urged by the assertion that the number in a large
city is as great as in all England. The natural inference
is that our judges work less effectively.</p>

<p>No statement could be based upon falser
premises. The roll of judges in the High Court
is, indeed, a limited one and, as they try small
as well as large cases, the impression might follow
that they constitute the whole judicial force of
England. The fact, however, is quite the reverse.</p>

<p>Taking at random the daily Official Cause
List for London there will be found on a given
day sitting at the Law Courts in the Strand
alone, twenty-one judges of the High Court,
eight masters, seven Chancery registrars, twelve
masters in Chancery, three official referees, two
registrars in bankruptcy and one official presiding
over "companies winding up"&mdash;exactly fifty-four
men simultaneously performing judicial
duty in one building. Each of these is holding
what is practically a separate court and his title
is of no significance. When one remembers that
at the same time the House of Lords is sitting
at Westminster, the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council in Downing Street, the four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Criminal Courts at the Old Bailey, more than
twenty police magistrates at Bow Street and
elsewhere, and County Courts, at Bloomsbury,
Clerkenwell, Edmonton, Marylebone, Shoreditch,
Southwark and Westminster, some idea
may be formed of the number of judges and
courts always at work in the metropolis.</p>

<p>Innumerable courts are also sitting in the
provinces, which, if less important, serve to relieve
the metropolitan judges. The justices of
the peace number in many counties three or four
hundred and in one county about eight hundred,
although most of them never attend and the work
is done by comparatively few. They sit singly
as committing magistrates and in groups at petty
sessions and at quarter sessions. There are also
a large number of borough criminal courts presided
over by a recorder. Besides, the county
courts are over five hundred in the aggregate,
though there are not so many county judges,
for the smaller courts are grouped into circuits.
Finally, there are the Assizes of the High Court
coming down periodically from London to try
causes, both criminal and civil, all over England.</p>

<p>Thus the little Island fairly bristles with tribunals
and teems with judges and any criticism
of American judges or of American judicial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
methods by such comparison would only be possible
in ignorance of the facts.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In America, litigation begins in the court
room; in England, it ends there. American proceedings
tend to be somewhat formal, conventional,
diffuse and dilatory. Pitfalls and traps
are occasionally laid by astute practitioners,
which embarrass the side really in the right and
delay a conclusion upon the merits. Much is incomprehensible
to the laymen concerned except
the result.</p>

<p>English legal proceedings on the contrary are
colloquial, flexible, simple and prompt, thoroughly
in touch with the spirit of the times and with
the ordinary man's every-day life.</p>

<p>The legal decisions of the two countries are
probably of equal value, and are held in mutual
respect. Neither, perhaps, could claim any superiority
over the other in its legal results, but
in methods, England at present is far in advance.</p>

<p>This was not always so. Up to 1875 the English
courts were most slow, expensive and unsatisfactory.
But in these thirty-five years, reforms
in methods have so progressed, step by
step, that the most important action can be tried,
a judgment given, appeal taken, argued and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
orally decided as counsel sit down&mdash;all in ninety
days. The details of these improvements are too
technical for the present occasion; suffice it to
say that they are characterized by the utmost
simplicity, and many of them are capable of
adaptation with modifications to American conditions.</p>

<p>In America, the Bar is almost unorganized.
It has little voice in the selection of the judges,
of whose qualifications the politicians have no
knowledge; it is weak in disciplining and purging
itself and in commanding public respect for
its rights; its standards of professional propriety
are not clearly enough established, although
great improvement is noticeable in all
these respects. In England, the Bar is well
organized and governs the whole administration
of the law, jealously resenting any interference
with its ancient prerogatives and preserving its
own professional honor.</p>

<p>Thus, a close observation of professional life
in England will prove instructive and suggestive
to the ever-alert American. Nevertheless he will
depart with a feeling that, while at home there
is room for progress, yet, upon the whole, the old
profession in the New World well maintains its
proud position.</p>
